Our approach obtains strong performance without labeled simplification data, we match or outperform the supervised state of the art in English, French and Spanish. We show that simplification models trained on mined paraphrase. data perform as well as models trained. on existing large paraphrase corpora (cf.section 5.4). Our resulting Multilingual Unsupervised Sentence Simplification method, MUSS, is unsupervised because it can be trained without relying on labeled. data,!  The performance of unsupervised methods are often below their supervised counterparts. MUSS bridges the gap with supervised method and removes the need for deciding in advance how complex and simple sentences should be separated, but instead trains on paraphrases mined from the raw corpora.
