Hence, the question of what influences projects’ fundraising success is very important. Previous studies examined various factors such as project goals and project duration that may influence the outcomes of fundraising campaigns. We present a novel model for predicting the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. Our model focuses on semantic features only, whose performance is comparable to that of previous models. In an additional model we developed, we examine both project metadata and project semantics, delivering a comprehensive study of factors influencing crowdfunding success. Further, we analyze a large dataset of crowdfunding project data, larger than reportec in the art. Finally, we show that when combining semantics and metadata, we arrive at F1 score accuracy of 96.2%. We compare our model\\'s accuracy to the accuracy of previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset, and demonstrate higher accuracy of our model. In addition to our scientific contribution, we provide practical recommendations that may increase project funding success chances.  </p><h2>Introduction  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding has emerged as a popular financing mechanism that allows various types of projects to get funded. Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><p>Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </p><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur\\'s projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/33.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/34.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/35.png\"/><p>Fig 2.

The second is the CFS algorithm. , oe aa a, aa Features that highly correlate with funding success. Below in Table 1, for each of the three datasets, we list the 10 features for which the highest correlation values to FS were derived. The semantics of features annotated with * are provided in LIWC documentation (R_AILD stands for Ranked features from All_D). Feature selection. We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset. The CFS algorithm evaluates subsets of features based on the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. The following are the algorithm’s results.  </p><p>From the above results, we conclude that there are various semantic features that have a high correlation to FS among the features we checked based on the project’s category. Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/38.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/39.png\"/><p>LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare. The Figure shows that the model we developed has the highest accuracy. The accuracy of the Semantic-Model is similar to the accuracy of the LDA-Model and higher than the accuracy of the  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/40.png\"/><h2>Conclusion and future work  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been offering entrepreneurs the possibility to present their projects and attract funders, and thus raise the funds necessary for their projects. The question of how different properties of the project\\'s presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/41.png\"/><p>Fig 3. Comparison of models’ accuracy.  </p><p>from previous studies. We have shown that the category of the project influences the features that have a high correlation with funding success. We offer (example) for technological projects, as follows: + Entrepreneurs should update their project information during the funding period. + The project’s post should contain more feelings words. While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p><h2></h2> '"

The energy density of the system is mostly determined by the redox potential of the electrodes and the amount of charge they can store. The lifetime of battery cells, namely the number of cycles they can sustain while maintaining performance, relies on the reactions between the electrodes and the electrolyte?! These are the result of chemical and instability of the electrolyte (typically a salt dissolved in a mixture of organic carbonates) in the presence of strongly reducing (anodes) and oxidizing (cathodes) electrodes and result in complex interfacial processes, which irreversibly consume capacity and lead to accumulation of phases on the electrodes’ surface. As these interphases can completely alter the properties of the electrodes, they essentially control the lifetime and performance of the cell] When these interphases are passivating the electrode surface, ie., they prevent further interfacial reactions and provide efficient ion transport, they are called the solid electrolyte interphase!) (SEI). When they are unstable or block the ions, these interphases are detrimental to the battery cell. Thus, great research efforts are devoted to understanding these interfacial processes in order to formulate guidelines for achieving control over their response, thereby enabling viable and long-lasting storage systems. In order to understand the interface (EEI), we need to be able to probe it. This is not a simple task: these interphases are thin, disordered, heterogeneous (composed of organic and inorganic phases), and can be very reactive. The EEIs are most commonly studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron microscopy (EM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and to some extent X-ray diffraction.) Establishing the composition and structure of interphases is a necessary step but it is not enough. To rationalize their effect on cell performance, we must be able to correlate their composition and architecture with their function, namely determine their ion transport properties. Impedance spectroscopy is commonly used to measure ionic transport and can be correlated to some extent with interfacial resistance, but it does not provide a direct means to follow transport.

Furthermore, as signal intensity is proportional to the number of nuclei, the resonance position and its area provide direct means to determine the presence and quantity of the interphases. In paramagnetic materials, the unpaired electrons couple to the nuclear spin through hyperfine interactions, which can significantly shift the resonance frequency (Fermi contact shift) and broaden the spectrum through dipolar interactions. These dominate the spectra of paramagnetic electrodes and provide insight into local geometry and bonding with the paramagnetic ion.

While the energy density of the cell is mostly determined by the redox potential of the electrodes and amount of charge they can store, the processes at the interface govern the battery’s lifetime and performance. Viable battery cells rely on unimpeded ion transport across this interface, which depends on its composition and structure. These properties are challenging to determine as interfacial phases are thin, disordered, heterogeneous, and can be very reactive. The recent developments and applications of solid state NMR spectroscopy in the study of interfacial phenomena in rechargeable batteries based on lithium and sodium chemistries are reviewed. The different NMR interactions are surveyed and how these are used to shed light on the chemical composition and architecture of interfacial phases as well as directly probe ion transport across them is described. By combining new methods in solid state NMR spectroscopy with other analytical tools, a holistic description of the interface can be obtained. This will enable the design of improved interfaces for developing battery cells with high energy, high power, and longer lifetime.  </p><h2>1. Introduction  </h2><p>Rechargeable batteries are the leading energy-storage technology for efficient utilization of renewable energy sources and electric At the forefront are lithium-ion batteries (LIB), with sodium (Na)-ion and new lithium (Li)-based chemistries such as Li-air and Li-sulfur advancing rapidly. To address the needs for large-scale applications such as grid storage and electric vehicles, batteries must provide high energy densities and long lifetimes.!\"I A battery cell is composed of two electrodes separated by an ion conducting electrolyte. The energy density of the system is mostly determined by the redox potential of the electrodes and the amount of charge they can store. The lifetime of battery cells, namely the number of cycles they can sustain while maintaining performance, relies on the reactions between the electrodes and the electrolyte?! These are the result of chemical and instability of the electrolyte (typically a salt dissolved in a mixture of organic carbonates) in the presence of strongly reducing (anodes) and oxidizing (cathodes) electrodes and result in complex interfacial processes, which irreversibly consume capacity and lead to accumulation of phases on the electrodes’ surface. As these interphases can completely alter the properties of the electrodes, they essentially control the lifetime and performance of the cell] When these interphases are passivating the electrode surface, ie., they prevent further interfacial reactions and provide efficient ion transport, they are called the solid electrolyte interphase!) (SEI). When they are unstable or block the ions, these interphases are detrimental to the battery cell. Thus, great research efforts are devoted to understanding these interfacial processes in order to formulate guidelines for achieving control over their response, thereby enabling viable and long-lasting storage systems. In order to understand the interface (EEI), we need to be able to probe it. This is not a simple task: these interphases are thin, disordered, heterogeneous (composed of organic and inorganic phases), and can be very reactive. The EEIs are most commonly studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron microscopy (EM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and to some extent X-ray diffraction.) Establishing the composition and structure of interphases is a necessary step but it is not enough. To rationalize their effect on cell performance, we must be able to correlate their composition and architecture with their function, namely determine their ion transport properties. Impedance spectroscopy is commonly used to measure ionic transport and can be correlated to some extent with interfacial resistance, but it does not provide a direct means to follow transport. In the past 20 years, solid state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy has emerged as an excellent approach for studying electrochemical processes in the bulk of electrode materials.”*) It is chemically specific, providing a quantitative measure for the evolution of phases and their structure at the atomic level. Most importantly, ssNMR can be used to directly follow the workhorses of rechargeable batteries, lithium and sodium ions, and determine their mobility at a wide range of time scales. As such, ssNMR is well poised to address the three aspects that are crucial for our understanding of the EEI: the composition of the interphases, their 3D architecture, and their effect on ion transfer.  </p><h2>1706496 (1 of 10)  </h2><p>Here, we aim to describe the main aspects and recent developments in ssNMR methodology for studying interfacial phenomena in rechargeable batteries. For a detailed description of the utilization of ssNMR to battery research and nanomaterials interfaces in general, we refer the reader to two excellent reviews published recently.)  </p><h2>2. The Solid State NMR Toolbox  </h2><p>Most of the elements in the periodic table have one or more nonzero nuclear spin isotope. When placed in a magnetic field, the Zeeman interaction lifts the degeneracy between nuclear spin states and their populations follow the Boltzmann distribution. In NMR, resonant radio frequency (RF) pulses excite the system out of its equilibrium state. The return to equilibrium, which is associated with precessing magnetic moments, is then recorded through induction. The frequency of precession (Larmor frequency) that is proportional to the energy gap between spin states is indicative of the chemical and electronic environment of the nuclei. Many of the phases typically found in the BEI contain NMR active nuclei. Some of them have high sensitivity and abundance and can be easily detected, while others require enrichment and/or other means for signal enhancement.

            "summary: In recent years, crowdfunding has emerged as a popular financing mechanism that allows various types of projects to get funded. Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4] In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal) Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success.  Using this analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers.\n",

            "source: <p></p><h1>Evaluation  </h1><p>Evaluation is a systematic determination of a subject's merit, worth and significance, using criteria governed by a set of standards . It can assist an organization, program, design, project or any other intervention or initiative to assess any aim, realisable concept/proposal, or any alternative, to help in decision-making ; or to ascertain the degree of achievement or value in regard to the aim and objectives and results of any such action that has been completed. The primary purpose of evaluation, in addition to gaining insight into prior or existing initiatives, is to enable reflection and assist in the identification of future change. Evaluation is often used to characterize and appraise subjects of interest in a wide range of human enterprises, including the arts , criminal justice , foundations , non-profit organizations , government , health care , and other human services. It is long term and done at the end of a period of time.  </p><h2>Definition [ edit ]  </h2><p>Evaluation is the structured interpretation and giving of meaning to predicted or actual impacts of proposals or results. It looks at original objectives, and at what is either predicted or what was accomplished and how it was accomplished. So evaluation can be formative , that is taking place during the development of a concept or proposal, project or organization, with the intention of improving the value or effectiveness of the proposal, project, or organisation. It can also be summative , drawing lessons from a completed action or project or an organisation at a later point in time or circumstance.  </p><p>Evaluation is inherently a theoretically informed approach (whether explicitly or not), and consequently any particular definition of evaluation would have been tailored to its context – the theory, needs, purpose, and methodology of the evaluation process itself. Having said this, evaluation has been defined as:  </p><ul><li>A systematic, rigorous, and meticulous application of scientific methods to assess the design, implementation, improvement, or outcomes of a program. It is a resource-intensive process, frequently requiring resources, such as, evaluate expertise, labor, time, and a sizable budget  </li><li>\"The critical assessment, in as objective a manner as possible, of the degree to which a service or its component parts fulfills stated goals\" (St Leger and Wordsworth-Bell). <sup>[ failed verification ] </sup>The focus of this definition is on attaining objective knowledge, and scientifically or quantitatively measuring predetermined and external concepts.  </li><li>\"A study designed to assist some audience to assess an object's merit and worth\" (Stufflebeam). <sup>[ failed verification ] </sup>In this definition the focus is on facts as well as value laden judgments of the programs outcomes and worth.  </li></ul><h3>Purpose [ edit ]  </h3><p>The main purpose of a program evaluation can be to \"determine the quality of a program by formulating a judgment\" Marthe Hurteau, Sylvain Houle, Stéphanie Mongiat (2009). An alternative view is that \"projects, evaluators, and other stakeholders (including funders) will all have potentially different ideas about how best to evaluate a project since each may have a different definition of 'merit'. The core of the problem is thus about defining what is of value.\" From this perspective, evaluation \"is a contested term\", as \"evaluators\" use the term evaluation to describe an assessment, or investigation of a program whilst others simply understand evaluation as being synonymous with applied research.  </p><p>There are two function considering to the evaluation purpose Formative Evaluations provide the information on the improving a product or a process Summative Evaluations provide information of short-term effectiveness or long-term impact to deciding the adoption of a product or process.  </p><p>Not all evaluations serve the same purpose some evaluations serve a monitoring function rather than focusing solely on measurable program outcomes or evaluation findings and a full list of types of evaluations would be difficult to compile. This is because evaluation is not part of a unified theoretical framework, drawing on a number of disciplines, which include management and organisational theory , policy analysis , education , sociology , social anthropology , and social change .  </p><h3>Discussion [ edit ]  </h3><p>However, the strict adherence to a set of methodological assumptions may make the field of evaluation more acceptable to a mainstream audience but this adherence will work towards preventing evaluators from developing new strategies for dealing with the myriad problems that programs face. It is claimed that only a minority of evaluation reports are used by the evaluand (client) (Datta, 2006). One justification of this is that \"when evaluation findings are challenged or utilization has failed, it was because stakeholders and clients found the inferences weak or the warrants unconvincing\" (Fournier and Smith, 1993). Some reasons for this situation may be the failure of the evaluator to establish a set of shared aims with the evaluand, or creating overly ambitious aims, as well as failing to compromise and incorporate the cultural differences of individuals and programs within the evaluation aims and process. None of these problems are due to a lack of a definition of evaluation but are rather due to evaluators attempting to impose predisposed notions and definitions of evaluations on clients. The central reason for the poor utilization of evaluations is arguably <sup>[ by whom? ] </sup>due to the lack of tailoring of evaluations to suit the needs of the client, due to a predefined idea (or definition) of what an evaluation is rather than what the client needs are (House, 1980). The development of a standard methodology for evaluation will require arriving at applicable ways of asking and stating the results of questions about ethics such as agent-principal, privacy, stakeholder definition, limited liability; and could-the-money-be-spent-more-wisely issues.  </p><h2>Standards [ edit ]  </h2><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png\"/><p>Depending on the topic of interest, there are professional groups that review the quality and rigor of evaluation processes.  </p><p>Evaluating programs and projects, regarding their value and impact within the context they are implemented, can be ethically challenging. Evaluators may encounter complex, culturally specific systems resistant to external evaluation. Furthermore, the project organization or other stakeholders may be invested in a particular evaluation outcome. Finally, evaluators themselves may encounter \" conflict of interest (COI) \" issues, or experience interference or pressure to present findings that support a particular assessment.  </p><p>General professional codes of conduct , as determined by the employing organization, usually cover three broad aspects of behavioral standards, and include inter- collegial relations (such as respect for diversity and privacy ), operational issues (due competence , documentation accuracy and appropriate use of resources), and conflicts of interest ( nepotism , accepting gifts and other kinds of favoritism). However, specific guidelines particular to the evaluator's role that can be utilized in the management of unique ethical challenges are required. The Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation has developed standards for program, personnel, and student evaluation. The Joint Committee standards are broken into four sections: Utility, Feasibility, Propriety, and Accuracy. Various European institutions have also prepared their own standards, more or less related to those produced by the Joint Committee. They provide guidelines about basing value judgments on systematic inquiry, evaluator competence and integrity, respect for people, and regard for the general and public welfare.  </p><p>The American Evaluation Association has created a set of Guiding Principles for evaluators. The order of these principles does not imply priority among them; priority will vary by situation and evaluator role. The principles run as follows:  </p><ul><li>Systematic Inquiry : evaluators conduct systematic, data -based inquiries about whatever is being evaluated. This requires quality data collection, including a defensible choice of indicators, which lends credibility to findings. Findings are credible when they are demonstrably evidence-based, reliable and valid. This also pertains to the choice of methodology employed, such that it is consistent with the aims of the evaluation and provides dependable data. Furthermore, utility of findings is critical such that the information obtained by evaluation is comprehensive and timely, and thus serves to provide maximal benefit and use to stakeholders .  </li><li>Competence: evaluators provide competent performance to stakeholders . This requires that evaluation teams comprise an appropriate combination of competencies, such that varied and appropriate expertise is available for the evaluation process, and that evaluators work within their scope of capability.  </li><li>Integrity / Honesty : evaluators ensure the honesty and integrity of the entire evaluation process. A key element of this principle is freedom from bias in evaluation and this is underscored by three principles: impartiality, independence, and transparency.  </li></ul><blockquote></blockquote><p>Independence is attained through ensuring independence of judgment is upheld such that evaluation conclusions are not influenced or pressured by another party, and avoidance of conflict of interest, such that the evaluator does not have a stake in a particular conclusion. Conflict of interest is at issue particularly where funding of evaluations is provided by particular bodies with a stake in conclusions of the evaluation, and this is seen as potentially compromising the independence of the evaluator. Whilst it is acknowledged that evaluators may be familiar with agencies or projects that they are required to evaluate, independence requires that they not have been involved in the planning or implementation of the project. A declaration of interest should be made where any benefits or association with project are stated. Independence of judgment is required to be maintained against any pressures brought to bear on evaluators, for example, by project funders wishing to modify evaluations such that the project appears more effective than  </p><p>findings can verify.  </p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Impartiality pertains to findings being a fair and thorough assessment of strengths and weaknesses of a project or program. This requires taking due input from all stakeholders involved and findings presented without bias and with a transparent, proportionate, and persuasive link between findings and recommendations. Thus evaluators are required to delimit their findings to evidence. A mechanism to ensure impartiality is external and internal review. Such review is required of significant (determined in terms of cost or sensitivity) evaluations. The review is based on quality of work and the degree to which a demonstrable link is provided between findings  </p><p>and recommendations.  </p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Transparency requires that stakeholders are aware of the reason for the evaluation, the criteria by which evaluation occurs and the purposes to which the findings will be applied. Access to the evaluation document should be facilitated through findings being easily readable, with clear explanations of evaluation methodologies, approaches, sources of information, and costs  </p><p>incurred.  </p><ul><li>Respect for People: Evaluators respect the security , dignity and self-worth of the respondents, program participants , clients , and other stakeholders with whom they interact .This is particularly pertinent with regards to those who will be impacted upon by the evaluation findings. Protection of people includes ensuring informed consent from those involved in the evaluation, upholding confidentiality, and ensuring that the identity of those who may provide sensitive information towards the program evaluation is protected. Evaluators are ethically required to respect the customs and beliefs of those who are impacted upon by the evaluation or program activities. Examples of how such respect is demonstrated is through respecting local customs e.g. dress codes, respecting peoples privacy, and minimizing demands on others' time. Where stakeholders wish to place objections to evaluation findings, such a process should be facilitated through the local office of the evaluation organization, and procedures for lodging complaints or queries should be accessible and clear.  </li><li>Responsibilities for General and Public Welfare : Evaluators articulate and take into account the diversity of interests and values that may be related to the general and public welfare. Access to evaluation documents by the wider public should be facilitated such that discussion and feedback is enabled.  </li></ul><p>Furthermore, the international organizations such as the I.M.F. and the World Bank have independent evaluation functions. The various funds, programmes, and agencies of the United Nations has a mix of independent, semi-independent and self-evaluation functions, which have organized themselves as a system-wide UN Evaluation Group (UNEG), that works together to strengthen the function, and to establish UN norms and standards for evaluation. There is also an evaluation group within the OECD-DAC, which endeavors to improve development evaluation standards. The independent evaluation units of the major multinational development banks (MDBs) have also created the Evaluation Cooperation Group to strengthen the use of evaluation for greater MDB effectiveness and accountability, share lessons from MDB evaluations, and promote evaluation harmonization and collaboration.  </p><h2>Perspectives [ edit ]  </h2><p>The word \"evaluation\" has various connotations for different people, raising issues related to this process that include; what type of evaluation should be conducted; why there should be an evaluation process and how the evaluation is integrated into a program, for the purpose of gaining greater knowledge and awareness? There are also various factors inherent in the evaluation process, for example; to critically examine influences within a program that involve the gathering and analyzing of relative information about a program.  </p><p>Michael Quinn Patton motivated the concept that the evaluation procedure should be directed towards:  </p><p>Founded on another perspective of evaluation by Thomson and Hoffman in 2003, it is possible for a situation to be encountered, in which the process could not be considered advisable; for instance, in the event of a program being unpredictable, or unsound. This would include it lacking a consistent routine; or the concerned parties unable to reach an agreement regarding the purpose of the program. In addition, an influencer, or manager, refusing to incorporate relevant, important central issues within the evaluation  </p><h2>Approaches [ edit ]  </h2><p>There exist several conceptually distinct ways of thinking about, designing, and conducting evaluation efforts. Many of the evaluation approaches in use today make truly unique contributions to solving important problems, while others refine existing approaches in some way.  </p><h3>Classification of approaches [ edit ]  </h3><p>Two classifications of evaluation approaches by House and Stufflebeam and Webster can be combined into a manageable number of approaches in terms of their unique and important underlying principles. <sup>[ clarification needed ] </sup></p><p>House considers all major evaluation approaches to be based on a common ideology entitled liberal democracy . Important principles of this ideology include freedom of choice, the uniqueness of the individual and empirical inquiry grounded in objectivity . He also contends that they are all based on subjectivist ethics, in which ethical conduct is based on the subjective or intuitive experience of an individual or group. One form of subjectivist ethics is utilitarian , in which \" the good \" is determined by what maximizes a single, explicit interpretation of happiness for society as a whole. Another form of subjectivist ethics is intuitionist / pluralist , in which no single interpretation of \"the good\" is assumed and such interpretations need not be explicitly stated nor justified.  </p><p>These ethical positions have corresponding epistemologies — philosophies for obtaining knowledge . The objectivist epistemology is associated with the utilitarian ethic; in general, it is used to acquire knowledge that can be externally verified (intersubjective agreement) through publicly exposed methods and data . The subjectivist epistemology is associated with the intuitionist/pluralist ethic and is used to acquire new knowledge based on existing personal knowledge, as well as experiences that are (explicit) or are not (tacit) available for public inspection. House then divides each epistemological approach into two main political perspectives. Firstly, approaches can take an elite perspective, focusing on the interests of managers and professionals; or they also can take a mass perspective, focusing on consumers and participatory approaches.  </p><p>Stufflebeam and Webster place approaches into one of three groups, according to their orientation toward the role of values and ethical consideration. The political orientation promotes a positive or negative view of an object regardless of what its value actually is and might be—they call this pseudo-evaluation . The questions orientation includes approaches that might or might not provide answers specifically related to the value of an object—they call this quasi -evaluation. The values orientation includes approaches primarily intended to determine the value of an object—they call this true evaluation.  </p><p>When the above concepts are considered simultaneously, fifteen evaluation approaches can be identified in terms of epistemology, major perspective (from House), and orientation. Two pseudo-evaluation approaches, politically controlled and public relations studies, are represented. They are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Six quasi-evaluation approaches use an objectivist epistemology. Five of them— experimental research, management information systems , testing programs, objectives-based studies, and content analysis —take an elite perspective. Accountability takes a mass perspective. Seven true evaluation approaches are included. Two approaches, decision-oriented and policy studies, are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Consumer-oriented studies are based on an objectivist epistemology from a mass perspective. Two approaches—accreditation/certification and connoisseur studies—are based on a subjectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Finally, adversary and client-centered studies are based on a subjectivist epistemology from a mass perspective.  </p><h3>Summary of approaches [ edit ]  </h3><p>The following table is used to summarize each approach in terms of four attributes —organizer, purpose, strengths, and weaknesses. The organizer represents the main considerations or cues practitioners use to organize a study. The purpose represents the desired outcome for a study at a very general level. Strengths and weaknesses represent other attributes that should be considered when deciding whether to use the approach for a particular study. The following narrative highlights differences between approaches grouped together.

            "source: <p></p><h1>Evaluation  </h1><p>Evaluation is a systematic determination of a subject's merit, worth and significance, using criteria governed by a set of standards . It can assist an organization, program, design, project or any other intervention or initiative to assess any aim, realisable concept/proposal, or any alternative, to help in decision-making ; or to ascertain the degree of achievement or value in regard to the aim and objectives and results of any such action that has been completed. The primary purpose of evaluation, in addition to gaining insight into prior or existing initiatives, is to enable reflection and assist in the identification of future change. Evaluation is often used to characterize and appraise subjects of interest in a wide range of human enterprises, including the arts , criminal justice , foundations , non-profit organizations , government , health care , and other human services. It is long term and done at the end of a period of time.  </p><h2>Definition [ edit ]  </h2><p>Evaluation is the structured interpretation and giving of meaning to predicted or actual impacts of proposals or results. It looks at original objectives, and at what is either predicted or what was accomplished and how it was accomplished. So evaluation can be formative , that is taking place during the development of a concept or proposal, project or organization, with the intention of improving the value or effectiveness of the proposal, project, or organisation. It can also be summative , drawing lessons from a completed action or project or an organisation at a later point in time or circumstance.  </p><p>Evaluation is inherently a theoretically informed approach (whether explicitly or not), and consequently any particular definition of evaluation would have been tailored to its context – the theory, needs, purpose, and methodology of the evaluation process itself. Having said this, evaluation has been defined as:  </p><ul><li>A systematic, rigorous, and meticulous application of scientific methods to assess the design, implementation, improvement, or outcomes of a program. It is a resource-intensive process, frequently requiring resources, such as, evaluate expertise, labor, time, and a sizable budget  </li><li>\"The critical assessment, in as objective a manner as possible, of the degree to which a service or its component parts fulfills stated goals\" (St Leger and Wordsworth-Bell). <sup>[ failed verification ] </sup>The focus of this definition is on attaining objective knowledge, and scientifically or quantitatively measuring predetermined and external concepts.  </li><li>\"A study designed to assist some audience to assess an object's merit and worth\" (Stufflebeam). <sup>[ failed verification ] </sup>In this definition the focus is on facts as well as value laden judgments of the programs outcomes and worth.  </li></ul><h3>Purpose [ edit ]  </h3><p>The main purpose of a program evaluation can be to \"determine the quality of a program by formulating a judgment\" Marthe Hurteau, Sylvain Houle, Stéphanie Mongiat (2009). An alternative view is that \"projects, evaluators, and other stakeholders (including funders) will all have potentially different ideas about how best to evaluate a project since each may have a different definition of 'merit'. The core of the problem is thus about defining what is of value.\" From this perspective, evaluation \"is a contested term\", as \"evaluators\" use the term evaluation to describe an assessment, or investigation of a program whilst others simply understand evaluation as being synonymous with applied research.  </p><p>There are two function considering to the evaluation purpose Formative Evaluations provide the information on the improving a product or a process Summative Evaluations provide information of short-term effectiveness or long-term impact to deciding the adoption of a product or process.  </p><p>Not all evaluations serve the same purpose some evaluations serve a monitoring function rather than focusing solely on measurable program outcomes or evaluation findings and a full list of types of evaluations would be difficult to compile. This is because evaluation is not part of a unified theoretical framework, drawing on a number of disciplines, which include management and organisational theory , policy analysis , education , sociology , social anthropology , and social change .  </p><h3>Discussion [ edit ]  </h3><p>However, the strict adherence to a set of methodological assumptions may make the field of evaluation more acceptable to a mainstream audience but this adherence will work towards preventing evaluators from developing new strategies for dealing with the myriad problems that programs face. It is claimed that only a minority of evaluation reports are used by the evaluand (client) (Datta, 2006). One justification of this is that \"when evaluation findings are challenged or utilization has failed, it was because stakeholders and clients found the inferences weak or the warrants unconvincing\" (Fournier and Smith, 1993). Some reasons for this situation may be the failure of the evaluator to establish a set of shared aims with the evaluand, or creating overly ambitious aims, as well as failing to compromise and incorporate the cultural differences of individuals and programs within the evaluation aims and process. None of these problems are due to a lack of a definition of evaluation but are rather due to evaluators attempting to impose predisposed notions and definitions of evaluations on clients. The central reason for the poor utilization of evaluations is arguably <sup>[ by whom? ] </sup>due to the lack of tailoring of evaluations to suit the needs of the client, due to a predefined idea (or definition) of what an evaluation is rather than what the client needs are (House, 1980). The development of a standard methodology for evaluation will require arriving at applicable ways of asking and stating the results of questions about ethics such as agent-principal, privacy, stakeholder definition, limited liability; and could-the-money-be-spent-more-wisely issues.  </p><h2>Standards [ edit ]  </h2><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png\"/><p>Depending on the topic of interest, there are professional groups that review the quality and rigor of evaluation processes.  </p><p>Evaluating programs and projects, regarding their value and impact within the context they are implemented, can be ethically challenging. Evaluators may encounter complex, culturally specific systems resistant to external evaluation. Furthermore, the project organization or other stakeholders may be invested in a particular evaluation outcome. Finally, evaluators themselves may encounter \" conflict of interest (COI) \" issues, or experience interference or pressure to present findings that support a particular assessment.  </p><p>General professional codes of conduct , as determined by the employing organization, usually cover three broad aspects of behavioral standards, and include inter- collegial relations (such as respect for diversity and privacy ), operational issues (due competence , documentation accuracy and appropriate use of resources), and conflicts of interest ( nepotism , accepting gifts and other kinds of favoritism). However, specific guidelines particular to the evaluator's role that can be utilized in the management of unique ethical challenges are required. The Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation has developed standards for program, personnel, and student evaluation. The Joint Committee standards are broken into four sections: Utility, Feasibility, Propriety, and Accuracy. Various European institutions have also prepared their own standards, more or less related to those produced by the Joint Committee. They provide guidelines about basing value judgments on systematic inquiry, evaluator competence and integrity, respect for people, and regard for the general and public welfare.  </p><p>The American Evaluation Association has created a set of Guiding Principles for evaluators. The order of these principles does not imply priority among them; priority will vary by situation and evaluator role. The principles run as follows:  </p><ul><li>Systematic Inquiry : evaluators conduct systematic, data -based inquiries about whatever is being evaluated. This requires quality data collection, including a defensible choice of indicators, which lends credibility to findings. Findings are credible when they are demonstrably evidence-based, reliable and valid. This also pertains to the choice of methodology employed, such that it is consistent with the aims of the evaluation and provides dependable data. Furthermore, utility of findings is critical such that the information obtained by evaluation is comprehensive and timely, and thus serves to provide maximal benefit and use to stakeholders .  </li><li>Competence: evaluators provide competent performance to stakeholders . This requires that evaluation teams comprise an appropriate combination of competencies, such that varied and appropriate expertise is available for the evaluation process, and that evaluators work within their scope of capability.  </li><li>Integrity / Honesty : evaluators ensure the honesty and integrity of the entire evaluation process. A key element of this principle is freedom from bias in evaluation and this is underscored by three principles: impartiality, independence, and transparency.  </li></ul><blockquote></blockquote><p>Independence is attained through ensuring independence of judgment is upheld such that evaluation conclusions are not influenced or pressured by another party, and avoidance of conflict of interest, such that the evaluator does not have a stake in a particular conclusion. Conflict of interest is at issue particularly where funding of evaluations is provided by particular bodies with a stake in conclusions of the evaluation, and this is seen as potentially compromising the independence of the evaluator. Whilst it is acknowledged that evaluators may be familiar with agencies or projects that they are required to evaluate, independence requires that they not have been involved in the planning or implementation of the project. A declaration of interest should be made where any benefits or association with project are stated. Independence of judgment is required to be maintained against any pressures brought to bear on evaluators, for example, by project funders wishing to modify evaluations such that the project appears more effective than  </p><p>findings can verify.  </p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Impartiality pertains to findings being a fair and thorough assessment of strengths and weaknesses of a project or program. This requires taking due input from all stakeholders involved and findings presented without bias and with a transparent, proportionate, and persuasive link between findings and recommendations. Thus evaluators are required to delimit their findings to evidence. A mechanism to ensure impartiality is external and internal review. Such review is required of significant (determined in terms of cost or sensitivity) evaluations. The review is based on quality of work and the degree to which a demonstrable link is provided between findings  </p><p>and recommendations.  </p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Transparency requires that stakeholders are aware of the reason for the evaluation, the criteria by which evaluation occurs and the purposes to which the findings will be applied. Access to the evaluation document should be facilitated through findings being easily readable, with clear explanations of evaluation methodologies, approaches, sources of information, and costs  </p><p>incurred.  </p><ul><li>Respect for People: Evaluators respect the security , dignity and self-worth of the respondents, program participants , clients , and other stakeholders with whom they interact .This is particularly pertinent with regards to those who will be impacted upon by the evaluation findings. Protection of people includes ensuring informed consent from those involved in the evaluation, upholding confidentiality, and ensuring that the identity of those who may provide sensitive information towards the program evaluation is protected. Evaluators are ethically required to respect the customs and beliefs of those who are impacted upon by the evaluation or program activities. Examples of how such respect is demonstrated is through respecting local customs e.g. dress codes, respecting peoples privacy, and minimizing demands on others' time. Where stakeholders wish to place objections to evaluation findings, such a process should be facilitated through the local office of the evaluation organization, and procedures for lodging complaints or queries should be accessible and clear.  </li><li>Responsibilities for General and Public Welfare : Evaluators articulate and take into account the diversity of interests and values that may be related to the general and public welfare. Access to evaluation documents by the wider public should be facilitated such that discussion and feedback is enabled.  </li></ul><p>Furthermore, the international organizations such as the I.M.F. and the World Bank have independent evaluation functions. The various funds, programmes, and agencies of the United Nations has a mix of independent, semi-independent and self-evaluation functions, which have organized themselves as a system-wide UN Evaluation Group (UNEG), that works together to strengthen the function, and to establish UN norms and standards for evaluation. There is also an evaluation group within the OECD-DAC, which endeavors to improve development evaluation standards. The independent evaluation units of the major multinational development banks (MDBs) have also created the Evaluation Cooperation Group to strengthen the use of evaluation for greater MDB effectiveness and accountability, share lessons from MDB evaluations, and promote evaluation harmonization and collaboration.  </p><h2>Perspectives [ edit ]  </h2><p>The word \"evaluation\" has various connotations for different people, raising issues related to this process that include; what type of evaluation should be conducted; why there should be an evaluation process and how the evaluation is integrated into a program, for the purpose of gaining greater knowledge and awareness? There are also various factors inherent in the evaluation process, for example; to critically examine influences within a program that involve the gathering and analyzing of relative information about a program.  </p><p>Michael Quinn Patton motivated the concept that the evaluation procedure should be directed towards:  </p><p>Founded on another perspective of evaluation by Thomson and Hoffman in 2003, it is possible for a situation to be encountered, in which the process could not be considered advisable; for instance, in the event of a program being unpredictable, or unsound. This would include it lacking a consistent routine; or the concerned parties unable to reach an agreement regarding the purpose of the program. In addition, an influencer, or manager, refusing to incorporate relevant, important central issues within the evaluation  </p><h2>Approaches [ edit ]  </h2><p>There exist several conceptually distinct ways of thinking about, designing, and conducting evaluation efforts. Many of the evaluation approaches in use today make truly unique contributions to solving important problems, while others refine existing approaches in some way.  </p><h3>Classification of approaches [ edit ]  </h3><p>Two classifications of evaluation approaches by House and Stufflebeam and Webster can be combined into a manageable number of approaches in terms of their unique and important underlying principles. <sup>[ clarification needed ] </sup></p><p>House considers all major evaluation approaches to be based on a common ideology entitled liberal democracy . Important principles of this ideology include freedom of choice, the uniqueness of the individual and empirical inquiry grounded in objectivity . He also contends that they are all based on subjectivist ethics, in which ethical conduct is based on the subjective or intuitive experience of an individual or group. One form of subjectivist ethics is utilitarian , in which \" the good \" is determined by what maximizes a single, explicit interpretation of happiness for society as a whole. Another form of subjectivist ethics is intuitionist / pluralist , in which no single interpretation of \"the good\" is assumed and such interpretations need not be explicitly stated nor justified.  </p><p>These ethical positions have corresponding epistemologies — philosophies for obtaining knowledge . The objectivist epistemology is associated with the utilitarian ethic; in general, it is used to acquire knowledge that can be externally verified (intersubjective agreement) through publicly exposed methods and data . The subjectivist epistemology is associated with the intuitionist/pluralist ethic and is used to acquire new knowledge based on existing personal knowledge, as well as experiences that are (explicit) or are not (tacit) available for public inspection. House then divides each epistemological approach into two main political perspectives. Firstly, approaches can take an elite perspective, focusing on the interests of managers and professionals; or they also can take a mass perspective, focusing on consumers and participatory approaches.  </p><p>Stufflebeam and Webster place approaches into one of three groups, according to their orientation toward the role of values and ethical consideration. The political orientation promotes a positive or negative view of an object regardless of what its value actually is and might be—they call this pseudo-evaluation . The questions orientation includes approaches that might or might not provide answers specifically related to the value of an object—they call this quasi -evaluation. The values orientation includes approaches primarily intended to determine the value of an object—they call this true evaluation.  </p><p>When the above concepts are considered simultaneously, fifteen evaluation approaches can be identified in terms of epistemology, major perspective (from House), and orientation. Two pseudo-evaluation approaches, politically controlled and public relations studies, are represented. They are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Six quasi-evaluation approaches use an objectivist epistemology. Five of them— experimental research, management information systems , testing programs, objectives-based studies, and content analysis —take an elite perspective. Accountability takes a mass perspective. Seven true evaluation approaches are included. Two approaches, decision-oriented and policy studies, are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Consumer-oriented studies are based on an objectivist epistemology from a mass perspective. Two approaches—accreditation/certification and connoisseur studies—are based on a subjectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Finally, adversary and client-centered studies are based on a subjectivist epistemology from a mass perspective.  </p><h3>Summary of approaches [ edit ]  </h3><p>The following table is used to summarize each approach in terms of four attributes —organizer, purpose, strengths, and weaknesses. The organizer represents the main considerations or cues practitioners use to organize a study. The purpose represents the desired outcome for a study at a very general level. Strengths and weaknesses represent other attributes that should be considered when deciding whether to use the approach for a particular study. The following narrative highlights differences between approaches grouped together.

However, specific guidelines particular to the evaluator's role that can be utilized in the management of unique ethical challenges are required. The Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation has developed standards for program, personnel, and student evaluation. The Joint Committee standards are broken into four sections: Utility, Feasibility, Propriety, and Accuracy. Various European institutions have also prepared their own standards, more or less related to those produced by the Joint Committee. They provide guidelines about basing value judgments on systematic inquiry, evaluator competence and integrity, respect for people, and regard for the general and public welfare.  </p><p>The American Evaluation Association has created a set of Guiding Principles for evaluators. The order of these principles does not imply priority among them; priority will vary by situation and evaluator role. The principles run as follows:  </p><ul><li>Systematic Inquiry : evaluators conduct systematic, data -based inquiries about whatever is being evaluated. This requires quality data collection, including a defensible choice of indicators, which lends credibility to findings. Findings are credible when they are demonstrably evidence-based, reliable and valid. This also pertains to the choice of methodology employed, such that it is consistent with the aims of the evaluation and provides dependable data. Furthermore, utility of findings is critical such that the information obtained by evaluation is comprehensive and timely, and thus serves to provide maximal benefit and use to stakeholders .  </li><li>Competence: evaluators provide competent performance to stakeholders . This requires that evaluation teams comprise an appropriate combination of competencies, such that varied and appropriate expertise is available for the evaluation process, and that evaluators work within their scope of capability.  </li><li>Integrity / Honesty : evaluators ensure the honesty and integrity of the entire evaluation process. A key element of this principle is freedom from bias in evaluation and this is underscored by three principles: impartiality, independence, and transparency.  </li></ul><blockquote></blockquote><p>Independence is attained through ensuring independence of judgment is upheld such that evaluation conclusions are not influenced or pressured by another party, and avoidance of conflict of interest, such that the evaluator does not have a stake in a particular conclusion. Conflict of interest is at issue particularly where funding of evaluations is provided by particular bodies with a stake in conclusions of the evaluation, and this is seen as potentially compromising the independence of the evaluator. Whilst it is acknowledged that evaluators may be familiar with agencies or projects that they are required to evaluate, independence requires that they not have been involved in the planning or implementation of the project. A declaration of interest should be made where any benefits or association with project are stated. Independence of judgment is required to be maintained against any pressures brought to bear on evaluators, for example, by project funders wishing to modify evaluations such that the project appears more effective than  </p><p>findings can verify.  </p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Impartiality pertains to findings being a fair and thorough assessment of strengths and weaknesses of a project or program. This requires taking due input from all stakeholders involved and findings presented without bias and with a transparent, proportionate, and persuasive link between findings and recommendations. Thus evaluators are required to delimit their findings to evidence. A mechanism to ensure impartiality is external and internal review. Such review is required of significant (determined in terms of cost or sensitivity) evaluations. The review is based on quality of work and the degree to which a demonstrable link is provided between findings  </p><p>and recommendations.  </p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Transparency requires that stakeholders are aware of the reason for the evaluation, the criteria by which evaluation occurs and the purposes to which the findings will be applied. Access to the evaluation document should be facilitated through findings being easily readable, with clear explanations of evaluation methodologies, approaches, sources of information, and costs  </p><p>incurred.  </p><ul><li>Respect for People: Evaluators respect the security , dignity and self-worth of the respondents, program participants , clients , and other stakeholders with whom they interact .This is particularly pertinent with regards to those who will be impacted upon by the evaluation findings. Protection of people includes ensuring informed consent from those involved in the evaluation, upholding confidentiality, and ensuring that the identity of those who may provide sensitive information towards the program evaluation is protected. Evaluators are ethically required to respect the customs and beliefs of those who are impacted upon by the evaluation or program activities. Examples of how such respect is demonstrated is through respecting local customs e.g. dress codes, respecting peoples privacy, and minimizing demands on others' time. Where stakeholders wish to place objections to evaluation findings, such a process should be facilitated through the local office of the evaluation organization, and procedures for lodging complaints or queries should be accessible and clear.  </li><li>Responsibilities for General and Public Welfare : Evaluators articulate and take into account the diversity of interests and values that may be related to the general and public welfare. Access to evaluation documents by the wider public should be facilitated such that discussion and feedback is enabled.  </li></ul><p>Furthermore, the international organizations such as the I.M.F. and the World Bank have independent evaluation functions. The various funds, programmes, and agencies of the United Nations has a mix of independent, semi-independent and self-evaluation functions, which have organized themselves as a system-wide UN Evaluation Group (UNEG), that works together to strengthen the function, and to establish UN norms and standards for evaluation. There is also an evaluation group within the OECD-DAC, which endeavors to improve development evaluation standards. The independent evaluation units of the major multinational development banks (MDBs) have also created the Evaluation Cooperation Group to strengthen the use of evaluation for greater MDB effectiveness and accountability, share lessons from MDB evaluations, and promote evaluation harmonization and collaboration.  </p><h2>Perspectives [ edit ]  </h2><p>The word \"evaluation\" has various connotations for different people, raising issues related to this process that include; what type of evaluation should be conducted; why there should be an evaluation process and how the evaluation is integrated into a program, for the purpose of gaining greater knowledge and awareness? There are also various factors inherent in the evaluation process, for example; to critically examine influences within a program that involve the gathering and analyzing of relative information about a program.  </p><p>Michael Quinn Patton motivated the concept that the evaluation procedure should be directed towards:  </p><p>Founded on another perspective of evaluation by Thomson and Hoffman in 2003, it is possible for a situation to be encountered, in which the process could not be considered advisable; for instance, in the event of a program being unpredictable, or unsound. This would include it lacking a consistent routine; or the concerned parties unable to reach an agreement regarding the purpose of the program. In addition, an influencer, or manager, refusing to incorporate relevant, important central issues within the evaluation  </p><h2>Approaches [ edit ]  </h2><p>There exist several conceptually distinct ways of thinking about, designing, and conducting evaluation efforts. Many of the evaluation approaches in use today make truly unique contributions to solving important problems, while others refine existing approaches in some way.  </p><h3>Classification of approaches [ edit ]  </h3><p>Two classifications of evaluation approaches by House and Stufflebeam and Webster can be combined into a manageable number of approaches in terms of their unique and important underlying principles. <sup>[ clarification needed ] </sup></p><p>House considers all major evaluation approaches to be based on a common ideology entitled liberal democracy . Important principles of this ideology include freedom of choice, the uniqueness of the individual and empirical inquiry grounded in objectivity . He also contends that they are all based on subjectivist ethics, in which ethical conduct is based on the subjective or intuitive experience of an individual or group. One form of subjectivist ethics is utilitarian , in which \" the good \" is determined by what maximizes a single, explicit interpretation of happiness for society as a whole. Another form of subjectivist ethics is intuitionist / pluralist , in which no single interpretation of \"the good\" is assumed and such interpretations need not be explicitly stated nor justified.  </p><p>These ethical positions have corresponding epistemologies — philosophies for obtaining knowledge . The objectivist epistemology is associated with the utilitarian ethic; in general, it is used to acquire knowledge that can be externally verified (intersubjective agreement) through publicly exposed methods and data . The subjectivist epistemology is associated with the intuitionist/pluralist ethic and is used to acquire new knowledge based on existing personal knowledge, as well as experiences that are (explicit) or are not (tacit) available for public inspection. House then divides each epistemological approach into two main political perspectives. Firstly, approaches can take an elite perspective, focusing on the interests of managers and professionals; or they also can take a mass perspective, focusing on consumers and participatory approaches.  </p><p>Stufflebeam and Webster place approaches into one of three groups, according to their orientation toward the role of values and ethical consideration. The political orientation promotes a positive or negative view of an object regardless of what its value actually is and might be—they call this pseudo-evaluation . The questions orientation includes approaches that might or might not provide answers specifically related to the value of an object—they call this quasi -evaluation. The values orientation includes approaches primarily intended to determine the value of an object—they call this true evaluation.  </p><p>When the above concepts are considered simultaneously, fifteen evaluation approaches can be identified in terms of epistemology, major perspective (from House), and orientation. Two pseudo-evaluation approaches, politically controlled and public relations studies, are represented. They are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Six quasi-evaluation approaches use an objectivist epistemology. Five of them— experimental research, management information systems , testing programs, objectives-based studies, and content analysis —take an elite perspective. Accountability takes a mass perspective. Seven true evaluation approaches are included. Two approaches, decision-oriented and policy studies, are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Consumer-oriented studies are based on an objectivist epistemology from a mass perspective. Two approaches—accreditation/certification and connoisseur studies—are based on a subjectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Finally, adversary and client-centered studies are based on a subjectivist epistemology from a mass perspective.  </p><h3>Summary of approaches [ edit ]  </h3><p>The following table is used to summarize each approach in terms of four attributes —organizer, purpose, strengths, and weaknesses. The organizer represents the main considerations or cues practitioners use to organize a study. The purpose represents the desired outcome for a study at a very general level. Strengths and weaknesses represent other attributes that should be considered when deciding whether to use the approach for a particular study. The following narrative highlights differences between approaches grouped together. Summary of approaches for conducting evaluations Approach Attribute Organizer Purpose Key strengths Key weaknesses Politically controlled Threats Get, keep or increase influence, power or money. Secure evidence advantageous to the client in a conflict. Violates the principle of full &amp; frank disclosure. Public relations Propaganda needs Create positive public image. Secure evidence most likely to bolster public support. Violates the principles of balanced reporting, justified conclusions, &amp; objectivity. Experimental research Causal relationships Determine causal relationships between variables. Strongest paradigm for determining causal relationships. Requires controlled setting, limits range of evidence, focuses primarily on results. Management information systems Scientific efficiency Continuously supply evidence needed to fund, direct, &amp; control programs. Gives managers detailed evidence about complex programs. Human service variables are rarely amenable to the narrow, quantitative definitions needed. Testing programs Individual differences Compare test scores of individuals &amp; groups to selected norms. Produces valid &amp; reliable evidence in many performance areas. Very familiar to public. Data usually only on testee performance, overemphasizes test-taking skills, can be poor sample of what is taught or expected. Objectives -based Objectives Relates outcomes to objectives. Common sense appeal, widely used, uses behavioral objectives &amp; testing technologies. Leads to terminal evidence often too narrow to provide basis for judging the value of a program. Content analysis Content of a communication Describe &amp; draw conclusion about a communication. Allows for unobtrusive analysis of large volumes of unstructured, symbolic materials. Sample may be unrepresentative yet overwhelming in volume. Analysis design often overly simplistic for question. Accountability Performance expectations Provide constituents with an accurate accounting of results. Popular with constituents. Aimed at improving quality of products and services. Creates unrest between practitioners &amp; consumers. Politics often forces premature studies. Decision -oriented Decisions Provide a knowledge &amp; value base for making &amp; defending decisions. Encourages use of evaluation to plan &amp; implement needed programs. Helps justify decisions about plans &amp; actions. Necessary collaboration between evaluator &amp; decision-maker provides opportunity to bias results. Policy studies Broad issues Identify and assess potential costs &amp; benefits of competing policies. Provide general direction for broadly focused actions. Often corrupted or subverted by politically motivated actions of participants. Consumer -oriented Generalized needs &amp; values, effects Judge the relative merits of alternative goods &amp; services. Independent appraisal to protect practitioners &amp; consumers from shoddy products &amp; services. High public credibility. Might not help practitioners do a better job. Requires credible &amp; competent evaluators. Accreditation / certification Standards &amp; guidelines Determine if institutions, programs, &amp; personnel should be approved to perform specified functions. Helps public make informed decisions about quality of organizations &amp; qualifications of personnel. Standards &amp; guidelines typically emphasize intrinsic criteria to the exclusion of outcome measures. Connoisseur Critical guideposts Critically describe, appraise, &amp; illuminate an object. Exploits highly developed expertise on subject of interest. Can inspire others to more insightful efforts. Dependent on small number of experts, making evaluation susceptible to subjectivity, bias, and corruption. Adversary Evaluation \"Hot\" issues Present the pro &amp; cons of an issue. Ensures balances presentations of represented perspectives. Can discourage cooperation, heighten animosities. Client-centered Specific concerns &amp; issues Foster understanding of activities &amp; how they are valued in a given setting &amp; from a variety of perspectives. Practitioners are helped to conduct their own evaluation. Low external credibility, susceptible to bias in favor of participants. Note. Adapted and condensed primarily from House (1978) and Stufflebeam &amp; Webster (1980).  </p><h3>Pseudo-evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><p>Politically controlled and public relations studies are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. <sup>[ clarification needed ] </sup>Although both of these approaches seek to misrepresent value interpretations about an object, they function differently from each other. Information obtained through politically controlled studies is released or withheld to meet the special interests of the holder, whereas public relations information creates a positive image of an object regardless of the actual situation. Despite the application of both studies in real scenarios, neither of these approaches is acceptable evaluation practice.  </p><h3>Objectivist, elite, quasi-evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><p>As a group, these five approaches represent a highly respected collection of disciplined inquiry approaches. They are considered quasi-evaluation approaches because particular studies legitimately can focus only on questions of knowledge without addressing any questions of value. Such studies are, by definition, not evaluations. These approaches can produce characterizations without producing appraisals, although specific studies can produce both. Each of these approaches serves its intended purpose well. They are discussed roughly in order of the extent to which they approach the objectivist ideal.  </p><ul><li>Experimental research is the best approach for determining causal relationships between variables . The potential problem with using this as an evaluation approach is that its highly controlled and stylized methodology may not be sufficiently responsive to the dynamically changing needs of most human service programs.  </li><li>Management information systems (MISs) can give detailed information about the dynamic operations of complex programs. However, this information is restricted to readily quantifiable data usually available at regular intervals.  </li><li>Testing programs are familiar to just about anyone who has attended school, served in the military, or worked for a large company. These programs are good at comparing individuals or groups to selected norms in a number of subject areas or to a set of standards of performance. However, they only focus on testee performance and they might not adequately sample what is taught or expected.  </li><li>Objectives -based approaches relate outcomes to prespecified objectives, allowing judgments to be made about their level of attainment. Unfortunately, the objectives are often not proven to be important or they focus on outcomes too narrow to provide the basis for determining the value of an object.  </li><li>Content analysis is a quasi-evaluation approach because content analysis judgments need not be based on value statements. Instead, they can be based on knowledge. Such content analyses are not evaluations. On the other hand, when content analysis judgments are based on values, such studies are evaluations.  </li></ul><h3>Objectivist, mass, quasi-evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Accountability is popular with constituents because it is intended to provide an accurate accounting of results that can improve the quality of products and services . However, this approach quickly can turn practitioners and consumers into adversaries when implemented in a heavy-handed fashion.  </li></ul><h3>Objectivist, elite, true evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Decision -oriented studies are designed to provide a knowledge base for making and defending decisions. This approach usually requires the close collaboration between an evaluator and decision-maker, allowing it to be susceptible to corruption and bias .  </li><li>Policy studies provide general guidance and direction on broad issues by identifying and assessing potential costs and benefits of competing policies . The drawback is these studies can be corrupted or subverted by the politically motivated actions of the participants.  </li></ul><h3>Objectivist, mass, true evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Consumer -oriented studies are used to judge the relative merits of goods and services based on generalized needs and values, along with a comprehensive range of effects. However, this approach does not necessarily help practitioners improve their work, and it requires a very good and credible evaluator to do it well.  </li></ul><h3>Subjectivist, elite, true evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Accreditation / certification programs are based on self-study and peer review of organizations, programs, and personnel. They draw on the insights, experience, and expertise of qualified individuals who use established guidelines to determine if the applicant should be approved to perform specified functions. However, unless performance-based standards are used, attributes of applicants and the processes they perform often are overemphasized in relation to measures of outcomes or effects.  </li><li>Connoisseur studies use the highly refined skills of individuals intimately familiar with the subject of the evaluation to critically characterize and appraise it. This approach can help others see programs in a new light, but it is difficult to find a qualified and unbiased connoisseur.  </li></ul><h3>Subject, mass, true evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>The adversary approach focuses on drawing out the pros and cons of controversial issues through quasi- legal proceedings . This helps ensure a balanced presentation of different perspectives on the issues, but it is also likely to discourage later cooperation and heighten animosities between contesting parties if \"winners\" and \"losers\" emerge.  </li></ul><h3>Client-centered [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Client-centered studies address specific concerns and issues of practitioners and other clients of the study in a particular setting. These studies help people understand the activities and values involved from a variety of perspectives. However, this responsive approach can lead to low external credibility and a favorable bias toward those who participated in the study.  </li></ul><h2>Methods and techniques [ edit ]  </h2><p>Evaluation is methodologically diverse. Methods may be qualitative or quantitative , and include case studies , survey research , statistical analysis , model building, and many more such as:  </p><h2>[ edit ]  </h2><h2>[ edit ]  </h2><h2>[ edit ]  </h2><img src=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1\"/>\n",

Important principles of this ideology include freedom of choice, the uniqueness of the individual and empirical inquiry grounded in objectivity . He also contends that they are all based on subjectivist ethics, in which ethical conduct is based on the subjective or intuitive experience of an individual or group. One form of subjectivist ethics is utilitarian , in which \" the good \" is determined by what maximizes a single, explicit interpretation of happiness for society as a whole. Another form of subjectivist ethics is intuitionist / pluralist , in which no single interpretation of \"the good\" is assumed and such interpretations need not be explicitly stated nor justified.  </p><p>These ethical positions have corresponding epistemologies — philosophies for obtaining knowledge . The objectivist epistemology is associated with the utilitarian ethic; in general, it is used to acquire knowledge that can be externally verified (intersubjective agreement) through publicly exposed methods and data . The subjectivist epistemology is associated with the intuitionist/pluralist ethic and is used to acquire new knowledge based on existing personal knowledge, as well as experiences that are (explicit) or are not (tacit) available for public inspection. House then divides each epistemological approach into two main political perspectives. Firstly, approaches can take an elite perspective, focusing on the interests of managers and professionals; or they also can take a mass perspective, focusing on consumers and participatory approaches.  </p><p>Stufflebeam and Webster place approaches into one of three groups, according to their orientation toward the role of values and ethical consideration. The political orientation promotes a positive or negative view of an object regardless of what its value actually is and might be—they call this pseudo-evaluation . The questions orientation includes approaches that might or might not provide answers specifically related to the value of an object—they call this quasi -evaluation. The values orientation includes approaches primarily intended to determine the value of an object—they call this true evaluation.  </p><p>When the above concepts are considered simultaneously, fifteen evaluation approaches can be identified in terms of epistemology, major perspective (from House), and orientation. Two pseudo-evaluation approaches, politically controlled and public relations studies, are represented. They are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Six quasi-evaluation approaches use an objectivist epistemology. Five of them— experimental research, management information systems , testing programs, objectives-based studies, and content analysis —take an elite perspective. Accountability takes a mass perspective. Seven true evaluation approaches are included. Two approaches, decision-oriented and policy studies, are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Consumer-oriented studies are based on an objectivist epistemology from a mass perspective. Two approaches—accreditation/certification and connoisseur studies—are based on a subjectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Finally, adversary and client-centered studies are based on a subjectivist epistemology from a mass perspective.  </p><h3>Summary of approaches [ edit ]  </h3><p>The following table is used to summarize each approach in terms of four attributes —organizer, purpose, strengths, and weaknesses. The organizer represents the main considerations or cues practitioners use to organize a study. The purpose represents the desired outcome for a study at a very general level. Strengths and weaknesses represent other attributes that should be considered when deciding whether to use the approach for a particular study. The following narrative highlights differences between approaches grouped together. Summary of approaches for conducting evaluations Approach Attribute Organizer Purpose Key strengths Key weaknesses Politically controlled Threats Get, keep or increase influence, power or money. Secure evidence advantageous to the client in a conflict. Violates the principle of full &amp; frank disclosure. Public relations Propaganda needs Create positive public image. Secure evidence most likely to bolster public support. Violates the principles of balanced reporting, justified conclusions, &amp; objectivity. Experimental research Causal relationships Determine causal relationships between variables. Strongest paradigm for determining causal relationships. Requires controlled setting, limits range of evidence, focuses primarily on results. Management information systems Scientific efficiency Continuously supply evidence needed to fund, direct, &amp; control programs. Gives managers detailed evidence about complex programs. Human service variables are rarely amenable to the narrow, quantitative definitions needed. Testing programs Individual differences Compare test scores of individuals &amp; groups to selected norms. Produces valid &amp; reliable evidence in many performance areas. Very familiar to public. Data usually only on testee performance, overemphasizes test-taking skills, can be poor sample of what is taught or expected. Objectives -based Objectives Relates outcomes to objectives. Common sense appeal, widely used, uses behavioral objectives &amp; testing technologies. Leads to terminal evidence often too narrow to provide basis for judging the value of a program. Content analysis Content of a communication Describe &amp; draw conclusion about a communication. Allows for unobtrusive analysis of large volumes of unstructured, symbolic materials. Sample may be unrepresentative yet overwhelming in volume. Analysis design often overly simplistic for question. Accountability Performance expectations Provide constituents with an accurate accounting of results. Popular with constituents. Aimed at improving quality of products and services. Creates unrest between practitioners &amp; consumers. Politics often forces premature studies. Decision -oriented Decisions Provide a knowledge &amp; value base for making &amp; defending decisions. Encourages use of evaluation to plan &amp; implement needed programs. Helps justify decisions about plans &amp; actions. Necessary collaboration between evaluator &amp; decision-maker provides opportunity to bias results. Policy studies Broad issues Identify and assess potential costs &amp; benefits of competing policies. Provide general direction for broadly focused actions. Often corrupted or subverted by politically motivated actions of participants. Consumer -oriented Generalized needs &amp; values, effects Judge the relative merits of alternative goods &amp; services. Independent appraisal to protect practitioners &amp; consumers from shoddy products &amp; services. High public credibility. Might not help practitioners do a better job. Requires credible &amp; competent evaluators. Accreditation / certification Standards &amp; guidelines Determine if institutions, programs, &amp; personnel should be approved to perform specified functions. Helps public make informed decisions about quality of organizations &amp; qualifications of personnel. Standards &amp; guidelines typically emphasize intrinsic criteria to the exclusion of outcome measures. Connoisseur Critical guideposts Critically describe, appraise, &amp; illuminate an object. Exploits highly developed expertise on subject of interest. Can inspire others to more insightful efforts. Dependent on small number of experts, making evaluation susceptible to subjectivity, bias, and corruption. Adversary Evaluation \"Hot\" issues Present the pro &amp; cons of an issue. Ensures balances presentations of represented perspectives. Can discourage cooperation, heighten animosities. Client-centered Specific concerns &amp; issues Foster understanding of activities &amp; how they are valued in a given setting &amp; from a variety of perspectives. Practitioners are helped to conduct their own evaluation. Low external credibility, susceptible to bias in favor of participants. Note. Adapted and condensed primarily from House (1978) and Stufflebeam &amp; Webster (1980).  </p><h3>Pseudo-evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><p>Politically controlled and public relations studies are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. <sup>[ clarification needed ] </sup>Although both of these approaches seek to misrepresent value interpretations about an object, they function differently from each other. Information obtained through politically controlled studies is released or withheld to meet the special interests of the holder, whereas public relations information creates a positive image of an object regardless of the actual situation. Despite the application of both studies in real scenarios, neither of these approaches is acceptable evaluation practice.  </p><h3>Objectivist, elite, quasi-evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><p>As a group, these five approaches represent a highly respected collection of disciplined inquiry approaches. They are considered quasi-evaluation approaches because particular studies legitimately can focus only on questions of knowledge without addressing any questions of value. Such studies are, by definition, not evaluations. These approaches can produce characterizations without producing appraisals, although specific studies can produce both. Each of these approaches serves its intended purpose well. They are discussed roughly in order of the extent to which they approach the objectivist ideal.  </p><ul><li>Experimental research is the best approach for determining causal relationships between variables . The potential problem with using this as an evaluation approach is that its highly controlled and stylized methodology may not be sufficiently responsive to the dynamically changing needs of most human service programs.  </li><li>Management information systems (MISs) can give detailed information about the dynamic operations of complex programs. However, this information is restricted to readily quantifiable data usually available at regular intervals.  </li><li>Testing programs are familiar to just about anyone who has attended school, served in the military, or worked for a large company. These programs are good at comparing individuals or groups to selected norms in a number of subject areas or to a set of standards of performance. However, they only focus on testee performance and they might not adequately sample what is taught or expected.  </li><li>Objectives -based approaches relate outcomes to prespecified objectives, allowing judgments to be made about their level of attainment. Unfortunately, the objectives are often not proven to be important or they focus on outcomes too narrow to provide the basis for determining the value of an object.  </li><li>Content analysis is a quasi-evaluation approach because content analysis judgments need not be based on value statements. Instead, they can be based on knowledge. Such content analyses are not evaluations. On the other hand, when content analysis judgments are based on values, such studies are evaluations.  </li></ul><h3>Objectivist, mass, quasi-evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Accountability is popular with constituents because it is intended to provide an accurate accounting of results that can improve the quality of products and services . However, this approach quickly can turn practitioners and consumers into adversaries when implemented in a heavy-handed fashion.  </li></ul><h3>Objectivist, elite, true evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Decision -oriented studies are designed to provide a knowledge base for making and defending decisions. This approach usually requires the close collaboration between an evaluator and decision-maker, allowing it to be susceptible to corruption and bias .  </li><li>Policy studies provide general guidance and direction on broad issues by identifying and assessing potential costs and benefits of competing policies . The drawback is these studies can be corrupted or subverted by the politically motivated actions of the participants.  </li></ul><h3>Objectivist, mass, true evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Consumer -oriented studies are used to judge the relative merits of goods and services based on generalized needs and values, along with a comprehensive range of effects. However, this approach does not necessarily help practitioners improve their work, and it requires a very good and credible evaluator to do it well.  </li></ul><h3>Subjectivist, elite, true evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Accreditation / certification programs are based on self-study and peer review of organizations, programs, and personnel. They draw on the insights, experience, and expertise of qualified individuals who use established guidelines to determine if the applicant should be approved to perform specified functions. However, unless performance-based standards are used, attributes of applicants and the processes they perform often are overemphasized in relation to measures of outcomes or effects.  </li><li>Connoisseur studies use the highly refined skills of individuals intimately familiar with the subject of the evaluation to critically characterize and appraise it. This approach can help others see programs in a new light, but it is difficult to find a qualified and unbiased connoisseur.  </li></ul><h3>Subject, mass, true evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>The adversary approach focuses on drawing out the pros and cons of controversial issues through quasi- legal proceedings . This helps ensure a balanced presentation of different perspectives on the issues, but it is also likely to discourage later cooperation and heighten animosities between contesting parties if \"winners\" and \"losers\" emerge.  </li></ul><h3>Client-centered [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Client-centered studies address specific concerns and issues of practitioners and other clients of the study in a particular setting. These studies help people understand the activities and values involved from a variety of perspectives. However, this responsive approach can lead to low external credibility and a favorable bias toward those who participated in the study.  </li></ul><h2>Methods and techniques [ edit ]  </h2><p>Evaluation is methodologically diverse.

            "source: <p></p><h1>Evaluation  </h1><p>Evaluation is a systematic determination of a subject's merit, worth and significance, using criteria governed by a set of standards . It can assist an organization, program, design, project or any other intervention or initiative to assess any aim, realisable concept/proposal, or any alternative, to help in decision-making ; or to ascertain the degree of achievement or value in regard to the aim and objectives and results of any such action that has been completed. The primary purpose of evaluation, in addition to gaining insight into prior or existing initiatives, is to enable reflection and assist in the identification of future change. Evaluation is often used to characterize and appraise subjects of interest in a wide range of human enterprises, including the arts , criminal justice , foundations , non-profit organizations , government , health care , and other human services. It is long term and done at the end of a period of time.  </p><h2>Definition [ edit ]  </h2><p>Evaluation is the structured interpretation and giving of meaning to predicted or actual impacts of proposals or results. It looks at original objectives, and at what is either predicted or what was accomplished and how it was accomplished. So evaluation can be formative , that is taking place during the development of a concept or proposal, project or organization, with the intention of improving the value or effectiveness of the proposal, project, or organisation. It can also be summative , drawing lessons from a completed action or project or an organisation at a later point in time or circumstance.  </p><p>Evaluation is inherently a theoretically informed approach (whether explicitly or not), and consequently any particular definition of evaluation would have been tailored to its context – the theory, needs, purpose, and methodology of the evaluation process itself. Having said this, evaluation has been defined as:  </p><ul><li>A systematic, rigorous, and meticulous application of scientific methods to assess the design, implementation, improvement, or outcomes of a program. It is a resource-intensive process, frequently requiring resources, such as, evaluate expertise, labor, time, and a sizable budget  </li><li>\"The critical assessment, in as objective a manner as possible, of the degree to which a service or its component parts fulfills stated goals\" (St Leger and Wordsworth-Bell). <sup>[ failed verification ] </sup>The focus of this definition is on attaining objective knowledge, and scientifically or quantitatively measuring predetermined and external concepts.  </li><li>\"A study designed to assist some audience to assess an object's merit and worth\" (Stufflebeam). <sup>[ failed verification ] </sup>In this definition the focus is on facts as well as value laden judgments of the programs outcomes and worth.  </li></ul><h3>Purpose [ edit ]  </h3><p>The main purpose of a program evaluation can be to \"determine the quality of a program by formulating a judgment\" Marthe Hurteau, Sylvain Houle, Stéphanie Mongiat (2009). An alternative view is that \"projects, evaluators, and other stakeholders (including funders) will all have potentially different ideas about how best to evaluate a project since each may have a different definition of 'merit'. The core of the problem is thus about defining what is of value.\" From this perspective, evaluation \"is a contested term\", as \"evaluators\" use the term evaluation to describe an assessment, or investigation of a program whilst others simply understand evaluation as being synonymous with applied research.  </p><p>There are two function considering to the evaluation purpose Formative Evaluations provide the information on the improving a product or a process Summative Evaluations provide information of short-term effectiveness or long-term impact to deciding the adoption of a product or process.  </p><p>Not all evaluations serve the same purpose some evaluations serve a monitoring function rather than focusing solely on measurable program outcomes or evaluation findings and a full list of types of evaluations would be difficult to compile. This is because evaluation is not part of a unified theoretical framework, drawing on a number of disciplines, which include management and organisational theory , policy analysis , education , sociology , social anthropology , and social change .  </p><h3>Discussion [ edit ]  </h3><p>However, the strict adherence to a set of methodological assumptions may make the field of evaluation more acceptable to a mainstream audience but this adherence will work towards preventing evaluators from developing new strategies for dealing with the myriad problems that programs face. It is claimed that only a minority of evaluation reports are used by the evaluand (client) (Datta, 2006). One justification of this is that \"when evaluation findings are challenged or utilization has failed, it was because stakeholders and clients found the inferences weak or the warrants unconvincing\" (Fournier and Smith, 1993). Some reasons for this situation may be the failure of the evaluator to establish a set of shared aims with the evaluand, or creating overly ambitious aims, as well as failing to compromise and incorporate the cultural differences of individuals and programs within the evaluation aims and process. None of these problems are due to a lack of a definition of evaluation but are rather due to evaluators attempting to impose predisposed notions and definitions of evaluations on clients. The central reason for the poor utilization of evaluations is arguably <sup>[ by whom? ] </sup>due to the lack of tailoring of evaluations to suit the needs of the client, due to a predefined idea (or definition) of what an evaluation is rather than what the client needs are (House, 1980). The development of a standard methodology for evaluation will require arriving at applicable ways of asking and stating the results of questions about ethics such as agent-principal, privacy, stakeholder definition, limited liability; and could-the-money-be-spent-more-wisely issues.  </p><h2>Standards [ edit ]  </h2><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png\"/><p>Depending on the topic of interest, there are professional groups that review the quality and rigor of evaluation processes.  </p><p>Evaluating programs and projects, regarding their value and impact within the context they are implemented, can be ethically challenging. Evaluators may encounter complex, culturally specific systems resistant to external evaluation. Furthermore, the project organization or other stakeholders may be invested in a particular evaluation outcome. Finally, evaluators themselves may encounter \" conflict of interest (COI) \" issues, or experience interference or pressure to present findings that support a particular assessment.  </p><p>General professional codes of conduct , as determined by the employing organization, usually cover three broad aspects of behavioral standards, and include inter- collegial relations (such as respect for diversity and privacy ), operational issues (due competence , documentation accuracy and appropriate use of resources), and conflicts of interest ( nepotism , accepting gifts and other kinds of favoritism). However, specific guidelines particular to the evaluator's role that can be utilized in the management of unique ethical challenges are required. The Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation has developed standards for program, personnel, and student evaluation. The Joint Committee standards are broken into four sections: Utility, Feasibility, Propriety, and Accuracy. Various European institutions have also prepared their own standards, more or less related to those produced by the Joint Committee. They provide guidelines about basing value judgments on systematic inquiry, evaluator competence and integrity, respect for people, and regard for the general and public welfare.  </p><p>The American Evaluation Association has created a set of Guiding Principles for evaluators. The order of these principles does not imply priority among them; priority will vary by situation and evaluator role. The principles run as follows:  </p><ul><li>Systematic Inquiry : evaluators conduct systematic, data -based inquiries about whatever is being evaluated. This requires quality data collection, including a defensible choice of indicators, which lends credibility to findings. Findings are credible when they are demonstrably evidence-based, reliable and valid. This also pertains to the choice of methodology employed, such that it is consistent with the aims of the evaluation and provides dependable data. Furthermore, utility of findings is critical such that the information obtained by evaluation is comprehensive and timely, and thus serves to provide maximal benefit and use to stakeholders .  </li><li>Competence: evaluators provide competent performance to stakeholders . This requires that evaluation teams comprise an appropriate combination of competencies, such that varied and appropriate expertise is available for the evaluation process, and that evaluators work within their scope of capability.  </li><li>Integrity / Honesty : evaluators ensure the honesty and integrity of the entire evaluation process. A key element of this principle is freedom from bias in evaluation and this is underscored by three principles: impartiality, independence, and transparency.  </li></ul><blockquote></blockquote><p>Independence is attained through ensuring independence of judgment is upheld such that evaluation conclusions are not influenced or pressured by another party, and avoidance of conflict of interest, such that the evaluator does not have a stake in a particular conclusion.

            "source: <p></p><h1>Evaluation  </h1><p>Evaluation is a systematic determination of a subject's merit, worth and significance, using criteria governed by a set of standards . It can assist an organization, program, design, project or any other intervention or initiative to assess any aim, realisable concept/proposal, or any alternative, to help in decision-making ; or to ascertain the degree of achievement or value in regard to the aim and objectives and results of any such action that has been completed. The primary purpose of evaluation, in addition to gaining insight into prior or existing initiatives, is to enable reflection and assist in the identification of future change. Evaluation is often used to characterize and appraise subjects of interest in a wide range of human enterprises, including the arts , criminal justice , foundations , non-profit organizations , government , health care , and other human services. It is long term and done at the end of a period of time.  </p><h2>Definition [ edit ]  </h2><p>Evaluation is the structured interpretation and giving of meaning to predicted or actual impacts of proposals or results. It looks at original objectives, and at what is either predicted or what was accomplished and how it was accomplished. So evaluation can be formative , that is taking place during the development of a concept or proposal, project or organization, with the intention of improving the value or effectiveness of the proposal, project, or organisation. It can also be summative , drawing lessons from a completed action or project or an organisation at a later point in time or circumstance.  </p><p>Evaluation is inherently a theoretically informed approach (whether explicitly or not), and consequently any particular definition of evaluation would have been tailored to its context – the theory, needs, purpose, and methodology of the evaluation process itself. Having said this, evaluation has been defined as:  </p><ul><li>A systematic, rigorous, and meticulous application of scientific methods to assess the design, implementation, improvement, or outcomes of a program. It is a resource-intensive process, frequently requiring resources, such as, evaluate expertise, labor, time, and a sizable budget  </li><li>\"The critical assessment, in as objective a manner as possible, of the degree to which a service or its component parts fulfills stated goals\" (St Leger and Wordsworth-Bell). <sup>[ failed verification ] </sup>The focus of this definition is on attaining objective knowledge, and scientifically or quantitatively measuring predetermined and external concepts.  </li><li>\"A study designed to assist some audience to assess an object's merit and worth\" (Stufflebeam). <sup>[ failed verification ] </sup>In this definition the focus is on facts as well as value laden judgments of the programs outcomes and worth.  </li></ul><h3>Purpose [ edit ]  </h3><p>The main purpose of a program evaluation can be to \"determine the quality of a program by formulating a judgment\" Marthe Hurteau, Sylvain Houle, Stéphanie Mongiat (2009). An alternative view is that \"projects, evaluators, and other stakeholders (including funders) will all have potentially different ideas about how best to evaluate a project since each may have a different definition of 'merit'. The core of the problem is thus about defining what is of value.\" From this perspective, evaluation \"is a contested term\", as \"evaluators\" use the term evaluation to describe an assessment, or investigation of a program whilst others simply understand evaluation as being synonymous with applied research.  </p><p>There are two function considering to the evaluation purpose Formative Evaluations provide the information on the improving a product or a process Summative Evaluations provide information of short-term effectiveness or long-term impact to deciding the adoption of a product or process.  </p><p>Not all evaluations serve the same purpose some evaluations serve a monitoring function rather than focusing solely on measurable program outcomes or evaluation findings and a full list of types of evaluations would be difficult to compile. This is because evaluation is not part of a unified theoretical framework, drawing on a number of disciplines, which include management and organisational theory , policy analysis , education , sociology , social anthropology , and social change .  </p><h3>Discussion [ edit ]  </h3><p>However, the strict adherence to a set of methodological assumptions may make the field of evaluation more acceptable to a mainstream audience but this adherence will work towards preventing evaluators from developing new strategies for dealing with the myriad problems that programs face. It is claimed that only a minority of evaluation reports are used by the evaluand (client) (Datta, 2006). One justification of this is that \"when evaluation findings are challenged or utilization has failed, it was because stakeholders and clients found the inferences weak or the warrants unconvincing\" (Fournier and Smith, 1993). Some reasons for this situation may be the failure of the evaluator to establish a set of shared aims with the evaluand, or creating overly ambitious aims, as well as failing to compromise and incorporate the cultural differences of individuals and programs within the evaluation aims and process. None of these problems are due to a lack of a definition of evaluation but are rather due to evaluators attempting to impose predisposed notions and definitions of evaluations on clients. The central reason for the poor utilization of evaluations is arguably <sup>[ by whom? ] </sup>due to the lack of tailoring of evaluations to suit the needs of the client, due to a predefined idea (or definition) of what an evaluation is rather than what the client needs are (House, 1980). The development of a standard methodology for evaluation will require arriving at applicable ways of asking and stating the results of questions about ethics such as agent-principal, privacy, stakeholder definition, limited liability; and could-the-money-be-spent-more-wisely issues.  </p><h2>Standards [ edit ]  </h2><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png\"/><p>Depending on the topic of interest, there are professional groups that review the quality and rigor of evaluation processes.  </p><p>Evaluating programs and projects, regarding their value and impact within the context they are implemented, can be ethically challenging. Evaluators may encounter complex, culturally specific systems resistant to external evaluation. Furthermore, the project organization or other stakeholders may be invested in a particular evaluation outcome. Finally, evaluators themselves may encounter \" conflict of interest (COI) \" issues, or experience interference or pressure to present findings that support a particular assessment.  </p><p>General professional codes of conduct , as determined by the employing organization, usually cover three broad aspects of behavioral standards, and include inter- collegial relations (such as respect for diversity and privacy ), operational issues (due competence , documentation accuracy and appropriate use of resources), and conflicts of interest ( nepotism , accepting gifts and other kinds of favoritism). However, specific guidelines particular to the evaluator's role that can be utilized in the management of unique ethical challenges are required. The Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation has developed standards for program, personnel, and student evaluation. The Joint Committee standards are broken into four sections: Utility, Feasibility, Propriety, and Accuracy. Various European institutions have also prepared their own standards, more or less related to those produced by the Joint Committee. They provide guidelines about basing value judgments on systematic inquiry, evaluator competence and integrity, respect for people, and regard for the general and public welfare.  </p><p>The American Evaluation Association has created a set of Guiding Principles for evaluators. The order of these principles does not imply priority among them; priority will vary by situation and evaluator role. The principles run as follows:  </p><ul><li>Systematic Inquiry : evaluators conduct systematic, data -based inquiries about whatever is being evaluated. This requires quality data collection, including a defensible choice of indicators, which lends credibility to findings. Findings are credible when they are demonstrably evidence-based, reliable and valid. This also pertains to the choice of methodology employed, such that it is consistent with the aims of the evaluation and provides dependable data. Furthermore, utility of findings is critical such that the information obtained by evaluation is comprehensive and timely, and thus serves to provide maximal benefit and use to stakeholders .  </li><li>Competence: evaluators provide competent performance to stakeholders . This requires that evaluation teams comprise an appropriate combination of competencies, such that varied and appropriate expertise is available for the evaluation process, and that evaluators work within their scope of capability.  </li><li>Integrity / Honesty : evaluators ensure the honesty and integrity of the entire evaluation process. A key element of this principle is freedom from bias in evaluation and this is underscored by three principles: impartiality, independence, and transparency.  </li></ul><blockquote></blockquote><p>Independence is attained through ensuring independence of judgment is upheld such that evaluation conclusions are not influenced or pressured by another party, and avoidance of conflict of interest, such that the evaluator does not have a stake in a particular conclusion. Conflict of interest is at issue particularly where funding of evaluations is provided by particular bodies with a stake in conclusions of the evaluation, and this is seen as potentially compromising the independence of the evaluator. Whilst it is acknowledged that evaluators may be familiar with agencies or projects that they are required to evaluate, independence requires that they not have been involved in the planning or implementation of the project. A declaration of interest should be made where any benefits or association with project are stated. Independence of judgment is required to be maintained against any pressures brought to bear on evaluators, for example, by project funders wishing to modify evaluations such that the project appears more effective than  </p><p>findings can verify.  </p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Impartiality pertains to findings being a fair and thorough assessment of strengths and weaknesses of a project or program. This requires taking due input from all stakeholders involved and findings presented without bias and with a transparent, proportionate, and persuasive link between findings and recommendations. Thus evaluators are required to delimit their findings to evidence. A mechanism to ensure impartiality is external and internal review. Such review is required of significant (determined in terms of cost or sensitivity) evaluations. The review is based on quality of work and the degree to which a demonstrable link is provided between findings  </p><p>and recommendations.  </p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Transparency requires that stakeholders are aware of the reason for the evaluation, the criteria by which evaluation occurs and the purposes to which the findings will be applied. Access to the evaluation document should be facilitated through findings being easily readable, with clear explanations of evaluation methodologies, approaches, sources of information, and costs  </p><p>incurred.  </p><ul><li>Respect for People: Evaluators respect the security , dignity and self-worth of the respondents, program participants , clients , and other stakeholders with whom they interact .This is particularly pertinent with regards to those who will be impacted upon by the evaluation findings. Protection of people includes ensuring informed consent from those involved in the evaluation, upholding confidentiality, and ensuring that the identity of those who may provide sensitive information towards the program evaluation is protected. Evaluators are ethically required to respect the customs and beliefs of those who are impacted upon by the evaluation or program activities. Examples of how such respect is demonstrated is through respecting local customs e.g. dress codes, respecting peoples privacy, and minimizing demands on others' time. Where stakeholders wish to place objections to evaluation findings, such a process should be facilitated through the local office of the evaluation organization, and procedures for lodging complaints or queries should be accessible and clear.  </li><li>Responsibilities for General and Public Welfare : Evaluators articulate and take into account the diversity of interests and values that may be related to the general and public welfare. Access to evaluation documents by the wider public should be facilitated such that discussion and feedback is enabled.  </li></ul><p>Furthermore, the international organizations such as the I.M.F. and the World Bank have independent evaluation functions. The various funds, programmes, and agencies of the United Nations has a mix of independent, semi-independent and self-evaluation functions, which have organized themselves as a system-wide UN Evaluation Group (UNEG), that works together to strengthen the function, and to establish UN norms and standards for evaluation. There is also an evaluation group within the OECD-DAC, which endeavors to improve development evaluation standards. The independent evaluation units of the major multinational development banks (MDBs) have also created the Evaluation Cooperation Group to strengthen the use of evaluation for greater MDB effectiveness and accountability, share lessons from MDB evaluations, and promote evaluation harmonization and collaboration.  </p><h2>Perspectives [ edit ]  </h2><p>The word \"evaluation\" has various connotations for different people, raising issues related to this process that include; what type of evaluation should be conducted; why there should be an evaluation process and how the evaluation is integrated into a program, for the purpose of gaining greater knowledge and awareness? There are also various factors inherent in the evaluation process, for example; to critically examine influences within a program that involve the gathering and analyzing of relative information about a program.  </p><p>Michael Quinn Patton motivated the concept that the evaluation procedure should be directed towards:  </p><p>Founded on another perspective of evaluation by Thomson and Hoffman in 2003, it is possible for a situation to be encountered, in which the process could not be considered advisable; for instance, in the event of a program being unpredictable, or unsound. This would include it lacking a consistent routine; or the concerned parties unable to reach an agreement regarding the purpose of the program. In addition, an influencer, or manager, refusing to incorporate relevant, important central issues within the evaluation  </p><h2>Approaches [ edit ]  </h2><p>There exist several conceptually distinct ways of thinking about, designing, and conducting evaluation efforts. Many of the evaluation approaches in use today make truly unique contributions to solving important problems, while others refine existing approaches in some way.  </p><h3>Classification of approaches [ edit ]  </h3><p>Two classifications of evaluation approaches by House and Stufflebeam and Webster can be combined into a manageable number of approaches in terms of their unique and important underlying principles. <sup>[ clarification needed ] </sup></p><p>House considers all major evaluation approaches to be based on a common ideology entitled liberal democracy . Important principles of this ideology include freedom of choice, the uniqueness of the individual and empirical inquiry grounded in objectivity . He also contends that they are all based on subjectivist ethics, in which ethical conduct is based on the subjective or intuitive experience of an individual or group. One form of subjectivist ethics is utilitarian , in which \" the good \" is determined by what maximizes a single, explicit interpretation of happiness for society as a whole. Another form of subjectivist ethics is intuitionist / pluralist , in which no single interpretation of \"the good\" is assumed and such interpretations need not be explicitly stated nor justified.  </p><p>These ethical positions have corresponding epistemologies — philosophies for obtaining knowledge . The objectivist epistemology is associated with the utilitarian ethic; in general, it is used to acquire knowledge that can be externally verified (intersubjective agreement) through publicly exposed methods and data . The subjectivist epistemology is associated with the intuitionist/pluralist ethic and is used to acquire new knowledge based on existing personal knowledge, as well as experiences that are (explicit) or are not (tacit) available for public inspection. House then divides each epistemological approach into two main political perspectives. Firstly, approaches can take an elite perspective, focusing on the interests of managers and professionals; or they also can take a mass perspective, focusing on consumers and participatory approaches.  </p><p>Stufflebeam and Webster place approaches into one of three groups, according to their orientation toward the role of values and ethical consideration. The political orientation promotes a positive or negative view of an object regardless of what its value actually is and might be—they call this pseudo-evaluation . The questions orientation includes approaches that might or might not provide answers specifically related to the value of an object—they call this quasi -evaluation. The values orientation includes approaches primarily intended to determine the value of an object—they call this true evaluation.  </p><p>When the above concepts are considered simultaneously, fifteen evaluation approaches can be identified in terms of epistemology, major perspective (from House), and orientation. Two pseudo-evaluation approaches, politically controlled and public relations studies, are represented. They are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Six quasi-evaluation approaches use an objectivist epistemology. Five of them— experimental research, management information systems , testing programs, objectives-based studies, and content analysis —take an elite perspective. Accountability takes a mass perspective. Seven true evaluation approaches are included. Two approaches, decision-oriented and policy studies, are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Consumer-oriented studies are based on an objectivist epistemology from a mass perspective. Two approaches—accreditation/certification and connoisseur studies—are based on a subjectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Finally, adversary and client-centered studies are based on a subjectivist epistemology from a mass perspective.  </p><h3>Summary of approaches [ edit ]  </h3><p>The following table is used to summarize each approach in terms of four attributes —organizer, purpose, strengths, and weaknesses. The organizer represents the main considerations or cues practitioners use to organize a study. The purpose represents the desired outcome for a study at a very general level.

It can assist an organization, program, design, project or any other intervention or initiative to assess any aim, realisable concept/proposal, or any alternative, to help in decision-making ; or to ascertain the degree of achievement or value in regard to the aim and objectives and results of any such action that has been completed. The primary purpose of evaluation, in addition to gaining insight into prior or existing initiatives, is to enable reflection and assist in the identification of future change.

It is claimed that only a minority of evaluation reports are used by the evaluand (client) (Datta, 2006). One justification of this is that \"when evaluation findings are challenged or utilization has failed, it was because stakeholders and clients found the inferences weak or the warrants unconvincing\" (Fournier and Smith, 1993). Some reasons for this situation may be the failure of the evaluator to establish a set of shared aims with the evaluand, or creating overly ambitious aims, as well as failing to compromise and incorporate the cultural differences of individuals and programs within the evaluation aims and process. None of these problems are due to a lack of a definition of evaluation but are rather due to evaluators attempting to impose predisposed notions and definitions of evaluations on clients. The central reason for the poor utilization of evaluations is arguably <sup>[ by whom? ] </sup>due to the lack of tailoring of evaluations to suit the needs of the client, due to a predefined idea (or definition) of what an evaluation is rather than what the client needs are (House, 1980). The development of a standard methodology for evaluation will require arriving at applicable ways of asking and stating the results of questions about ethics such as agent-principal, privacy, stakeholder definition, limited liability; and could-the-money-be-spent-more-wisely issues.  </p><h2>Standards [ edit ]  </h2><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png\"/><p>Depending on the topic of interest, there are professional groups that review the quality and rigor of evaluation processes.  </p><p>Evaluating programs and projects, regarding their value and impact within the context they are implemented, can be ethically challenging. Evaluators may encounter complex, culturally specific systems resistant to external evaluation. Furthermore, the project organization or other stakeholders may be invested in a particular evaluation outcome. Finally, evaluators themselves may encounter \" conflict of interest (COI) \" issues, or experience interference or pressure to present findings that support a particular assessment.  </p><p>General professional codes of conduct , as determined by the employing organization, usually cover three broad aspects of behavioral standards, and include inter- collegial relations (such as respect for diversity and privacy ), operational issues (due competence , documentation accuracy and appropriate use of resources), and conflicts of interest ( nepotism , accepting gifts and other kinds of favoritism). However, specific guidelines particular to the evaluator's role that can be utilized in the management of unique ethical challenges are required. The Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation has developed standards for program, personnel, and student evaluation. The Joint Committee standards are broken into four sections: Utility, Feasibility, Propriety, and Accuracy. Various European institutions have also prepared their own standards, more or less related to those produced by the Joint Committee. They provide guidelines about basing value judgments on systematic inquiry, evaluator competence and integrity, respect for people, and regard for the general and public welfare.  </p><p>The American Evaluation Association has created a set of Guiding Principles for evaluators. The order of these principles does not imply priority among them; priority will vary by situation and evaluator role. The principles run as follows:  </p><ul><li>Systematic Inquiry : evaluators conduct systematic, data -based inquiries about whatever is being evaluated. This requires quality data collection, including a defensible choice of indicators, which lends credibility to findings. Findings are credible when they are demonstrably evidence-based, reliable and valid. This also pertains to the choice of methodology employed, such that it is consistent with the aims of the evaluation and provides dependable data. Furthermore, utility of findings is critical such that the information obtained by evaluation is comprehensive and timely, and thus serves to provide maximal benefit and use to stakeholders .  </li><li>Competence: evaluators provide competent performance to stakeholders . This requires that evaluation teams comprise an appropriate combination of competencies, such that varied and appropriate expertise is available for the evaluation process, and that evaluators work within their scope of capability.  </li><li>Integrity / Honesty : evaluators ensure the honesty and integrity of the entire evaluation process. A key element of this principle is freedom from bias in evaluation and this is underscored by three principles: impartiality, independence, and transparency.  </li></ul><blockquote></blockquote><p>Independence is attained through ensuring independence of judgment is upheld such that evaluation conclusions are not influenced or pressured by another party, and avoidance of conflict of interest, such that the evaluator does not have a stake in a particular conclusion. Conflict of interest is at issue particularly where funding of evaluations is provided by particular bodies with a stake in conclusions of the evaluation, and this is seen as potentially compromising the independence of the evaluator. Whilst it is acknowledged that evaluators may be familiar with agencies or projects that they are required to evaluate, independence requires that they not have been involved in the planning or implementation of the project. A declaration of interest should be made where any benefits or association with project are stated. Independence of judgment is required to be maintained against any pressures brought to bear on evaluators, for example, by project funders wishing to modify evaluations such that the project appears more effective than  </p><p>findings can verify.  </p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Impartiality pertains to findings being a fair and thorough assessment of strengths and weaknesses of a project or program. This requires taking due input from all stakeholders involved and findings presented without bias and with a transparent, proportionate, and persuasive link between findings and recommendations. Thus evaluators are required to delimit their findings to evidence. A mechanism to ensure impartiality is external and internal review. Such review is required of significant (determined in terms of cost or sensitivity) evaluations. The review is based on quality of work and the degree to which a demonstrable link is provided between findings  </p><p>and recommendations.  </p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Transparency requires that stakeholders are aware of the reason for the evaluation, the criteria by which evaluation occurs and the purposes to which the findings will be applied. Access to the evaluation document should be facilitated through findings being easily readable, with clear explanations of evaluation methodologies, approaches, sources of information, and costs  </p><p>incurred.  </p><ul><li>Respect for People: Evaluators respect the security , dignity and self-worth of the respondents, program participants , clients , and other stakeholders with whom they interact .This is particularly pertinent with regards to those who will be impacted upon by the evaluation findings. Protection of people includes ensuring informed consent from those involved in the evaluation, upholding confidentiality, and ensuring that the identity of those who may provide sensitive information towards the program evaluation is protected. Evaluators are ethically required to respect the customs and beliefs of those who are impacted upon by the evaluation or program activities. Examples of how such respect is demonstrated is through respecting local customs e.g. dress codes, respecting peoples privacy, and minimizing demands on others' time. Where stakeholders wish to place objections to evaluation findings, such a process should be facilitated through the local office of the evaluation organization, and procedures for lodging complaints or queries should be accessible and clear.  </li><li>Responsibilities for General and Public Welfare : Evaluators articulate and take into account the diversity of interests and values that may be related to the general and public welfare. Access to evaluation documents by the wider public should be facilitated such that discussion and feedback is enabled.  </li></ul><p>Furthermore, the international organizations such as the I.M.F. and the World Bank have independent evaluation functions. The various funds, programmes, and agencies of the United Nations has a mix of independent, semi-independent and self-evaluation functions, which have organized themselves as a system-wide UN Evaluation Group (UNEG), that works together to strengthen the function, and to establish UN norms and standards for evaluation. There is also an evaluation group within the OECD-DAC, which endeavors to improve development evaluation standards. The independent evaluation units of the major multinational development banks (MDBs) have also created the Evaluation Cooperation Group to strengthen the use of evaluation for greater MDB effectiveness and accountability, share lessons from MDB evaluations, and promote evaluation harmonization and collaboration.  </p><h2>Perspectives [ edit ]  </h2><p>The word \"evaluation\" has various connotations for different people, raising issues related to this process that include; what type of evaluation should be conducted; why there should be an evaluation process and how the evaluation is integrated into a program, for the purpose of gaining greater knowledge and awareness? There are also various factors inherent in the evaluation process, for example; to critically examine influences within a program that involve the gathering and analyzing of relative information about a program.  </p><p>Michael Quinn Patton motivated the concept that the evaluation procedure should be directed towards:  </p><p>Founded on another perspective of evaluation by Thomson and Hoffman in 2003, it is possible for a situation to be encountered, in which the process could not be considered advisable; for instance, in the event of a program being unpredictable, or unsound. This would include it lacking a consistent routine; or the concerned parties unable to reach an agreement regarding the purpose of the program. In addition, an influencer, or manager, refusing to incorporate relevant, important central issues within the evaluation  </p><h2>Approaches [ edit ]  </h2><p>There exist several conceptually distinct ways of thinking about, designing, and conducting evaluation efforts. Many of the evaluation approaches in use today make truly unique contributions to solving important problems, while others refine existing approaches in some way.  </p><h3>Classification of approaches [ edit ]  </h3><p>Two classifications of evaluation approaches by House and Stufflebeam and Webster can be combined into a manageable number of approaches in terms of their unique and important underlying principles. <sup>[ clarification needed ] </sup></p><p>House considers all major evaluation approaches to be based on a common ideology entitled liberal democracy . Important principles of this ideology include freedom of choice, the uniqueness of the individual and empirical inquiry grounded in objectivity . He also contends that they are all based on subjectivist ethics, in which ethical conduct is based on the subjective or intuitive experience of an individual or group. One form of subjectivist ethics is utilitarian , in which \" the good \" is determined by what maximizes a single, explicit interpretation of happiness for society as a whole. Another form of subjectivist ethics is intuitionist / pluralist , in which no single interpretation of \"the good\" is assumed and such interpretations need not be explicitly stated nor justified.  </p><p>These ethical positions have corresponding epistemologies — philosophies for obtaining knowledge . The objectivist epistemology is associated with the utilitarian ethic; in general, it is used to acquire knowledge that can be externally verified (intersubjective agreement) through publicly exposed methods and data . The subjectivist epistemology is associated with the intuitionist/pluralist ethic and is used to acquire new knowledge based on existing personal knowledge, as well as experiences that are (explicit) or are not (tacit) available for public inspection. House then divides each epistemological approach into two main political perspectives. Firstly, approaches can take an elite perspective, focusing on the interests of managers and professionals; or they also can take a mass perspective, focusing on consumers and participatory approaches.  </p><p>Stufflebeam and Webster place approaches into one of three groups, according to their orientation toward the role of values and ethical consideration. The political orientation promotes a positive or negative view of an object regardless of what its value actually is and might be—they call this pseudo-evaluation . The questions orientation includes approaches that might or might not provide answers specifically related to the value of an object—they call this quasi -evaluation. The values orientation includes approaches primarily intended to determine the value of an object—they call this true evaluation.  </p><p>When the above concepts are considered simultaneously, fifteen evaluation approaches can be identified in terms of epistemology, major perspective (from House), and orientation. Two pseudo-evaluation approaches, politically controlled and public relations studies, are represented. They are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Six quasi-evaluation approaches use an objectivist epistemology. Five of them— experimental research, management information systems , testing programs, objectives-based studies, and content analysis —take an elite perspective. Accountability takes a mass perspective. Seven true evaluation approaches are included. Two approaches, decision-oriented and policy studies, are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Consumer-oriented studies are based on an objectivist epistemology from a mass perspective. Two approaches—accreditation/certification and connoisseur studies—are based on a subjectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Finally, adversary and client-centered studies are based on a subjectivist epistemology from a mass perspective.  </p><h3>Summary of approaches [ edit ]  </h3><p>The following table is used to summarize each approach in terms of four attributes —organizer, purpose, strengths, and weaknesses. The organizer represents the main considerations or cues practitioners use to organize a study. The purpose represents the desired outcome for a study at a very general level. Strengths and weaknesses represent other attributes that should be considered when deciding whether to use the approach for a particular study. The following narrative highlights differences between approaches grouped together. Summary of approaches for conducting evaluations Approach Attribute Organizer Purpose Key strengths Key weaknesses Politically controlled Threats Get, keep or increase influence, power or money. Secure evidence advantageous to the client in a conflict. Violates the principle of full &amp; frank disclosure. Public relations Propaganda needs Create positive public image. Secure evidence most likely to bolster public support. Violates the principles of balanced reporting, justified conclusions, &amp; objectivity. Experimental research Causal relationships Determine causal relationships between variables. Strongest paradigm for determining causal relationships. Requires controlled setting, limits range of evidence, focuses primarily on results. Management information systems Scientific efficiency Continuously supply evidence needed to fund, direct, &amp; control programs. Gives managers detailed evidence about complex programs. Human service variables are rarely amenable to the narrow, quantitative definitions needed. Testing programs Individual differences Compare test scores of individuals &amp; groups to selected norms. Produces valid &amp; reliable evidence in many performance areas. Very familiar to public. Data usually only on testee performance, overemphasizes test-taking skills, can be poor sample of what is taught or expected. Objectives -based Objectives Relates outcomes to objectives. Common sense appeal, widely used, uses behavioral objectives &amp; testing technologies. Leads to terminal evidence often too narrow to provide basis for judging the value of a program. Content analysis Content of a communication Describe &amp; draw conclusion about a communication. Allows for unobtrusive analysis of large volumes of unstructured, symbolic materials. Sample may be unrepresentative yet overwhelming in volume. Analysis design often overly simplistic for question. Accountability Performance expectations Provide constituents with an accurate accounting of results. Popular with constituents. Aimed at improving quality of products and services. Creates unrest between practitioners &amp; consumers. Politics often forces premature studies. Decision -oriented Decisions Provide a knowledge &amp; value base for making &amp; defending decisions. Encourages use of evaluation to plan &amp; implement needed programs. Helps justify decisions about plans &amp; actions. Necessary collaboration between evaluator &amp; decision-maker provides opportunity to bias results. Policy studies Broad issues Identify and assess potential costs &amp; benefits of competing policies. Provide general direction for broadly focused actions. Often corrupted or subverted by politically motivated actions of participants. Consumer -oriented Generalized needs &amp; values, effects Judge the relative merits of alternative goods &amp; services. Independent appraisal to protect practitioners &amp; consumers from shoddy products &amp; services. High public credibility. Might not help practitioners do a better job. Requires credible &amp; competent evaluators. Accreditation / certification Standards &amp; guidelines Determine if institutions, programs, &amp; personnel should be approved to perform specified functions. Helps public make informed decisions about quality of organizations &amp; qualifications of personnel. Standards &amp; guidelines typically emphasize intrinsic criteria to the exclusion of outcome measures. Connoisseur Critical guideposts Critically describe, appraise, &amp; illuminate an object. Exploits highly developed expertise on subject of interest. Can inspire others to more insightful efforts. Dependent on small number of experts, making evaluation susceptible to subjectivity, bias, and corruption. Adversary Evaluation \"Hot\" issues Present the pro &amp; cons of an issue. Ensures balances presentations of represented perspectives. Can discourage cooperation, heighten animosities. Client-centered Specific concerns &amp; issues Foster understanding of activities &amp; how they are valued in a given setting &amp; from a variety of perspectives. Practitioners are helped to conduct their own evaluation. Low external credibility, susceptible to bias in favor of participants. Note. Adapted and condensed primarily from House (1978) and Stufflebeam &amp; Webster (1980).  </p><h3>Pseudo-evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><p>Politically controlled and public relations studies are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. <sup>[ clarification needed ] </sup>Although both of these approaches seek to misrepresent value interpretations about an object, they function differently from each other. Information obtained through politically controlled studies is released or withheld to meet the special interests of the holder, whereas public relations information creates a positive image of an object regardless of the actual situation. Despite the application of both studies in real scenarios, neither of these approaches is acceptable evaluation practice.  </p><h3>Objectivist, elite, quasi-evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><p>As a group, these five approaches represent a highly respected collection of disciplined inquiry approaches. They are considered quasi-evaluation approaches because particular studies legitimately can focus only on questions of knowledge without addressing any questions of value. Such studies are, by definition, not evaluations. These approaches can produce characterizations without producing appraisals, although specific studies can produce both. Each of these approaches serves its intended purpose well. They are discussed roughly in order of the extent to which they approach the objectivist ideal.  </p><ul><li>Experimental research is the best approach for determining causal relationships between variables . The potential problem with using this as an evaluation approach is that its highly controlled and stylized methodology may not be sufficiently responsive to the dynamically changing needs of most human service programs.  </li><li>Management information systems (MISs) can give detailed information about the dynamic operations of complex programs. However, this information is restricted to readily quantifiable data usually available at regular intervals.  </li><li>Testing programs are familiar to just about anyone who has attended school, served in the military, or worked for a large company. These programs are good at comparing individuals or groups to selected norms in a number of subject areas or to a set of standards of performance. However, they only focus on testee performance and they might not adequately sample what is taught or expected.  </li><li>Objectives -based approaches relate outcomes to prespecified objectives, allowing judgments to be made about their level of attainment. Unfortunately, the objectives are often not proven to be important or they focus on outcomes too narrow to provide the basis for determining the value of an object.  </li><li>Content analysis is a quasi-evaluation approach because content analysis judgments need not be based on value statements. Instead, they can be based on knowledge. Such content analyses are not evaluations. On the other hand, when content analysis judgments are based on values, such studies are evaluations.  </li></ul><h3>Objectivist, mass, quasi-evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Accountability is popular with constituents because it is intended to provide an accurate accounting of results that can improve the quality of products and services . However, this approach quickly can turn practitioners and consumers into adversaries when implemented in a heavy-handed fashion.  </li></ul><h3>Objectivist, elite, true evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Decision -oriented studies are designed to provide a knowledge base for making and defending decisions. This approach usually requires the close collaboration between an evaluator and decision-maker, allowing it to be susceptible to corruption and bias .  </li><li>Policy studies provide general guidance and direction on broad issues by identifying and assessing potential costs and benefits of competing policies . The drawback is these studies can be corrupted or subverted by the politically motivated actions of the participants.  </li></ul><h3>Objectivist, mass, true evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Consumer -oriented studies are used to judge the relative merits of goods and services based on generalized needs and values, along with a comprehensive range of effects. However, this approach does not necessarily help practitioners improve their work, and it requires a very good and credible evaluator to do it well.  </li></ul><h3>Subjectivist, elite, true evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Accreditation / certification programs are based on self-study and peer review of organizations, programs, and personnel. They draw on the insights, experience, and expertise of qualified individuals who use established guidelines to determine if the applicant should be approved to perform specified functions. However, unless performance-based standards are used, attributes of applicants and the processes they perform often are overemphasized in relation to measures of outcomes or effects.  </li><li>Connoisseur studies use the highly refined skills of individuals intimately familiar with the subject of the evaluation to critically characterize and appraise it. This approach can help others see programs in a new light, but it is difficult to find a qualified and unbiased connoisseur.  </li></ul><h3>Subject, mass, true evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>The adversary approach focuses on drawing out the pros and cons of controversial issues through quasi- legal proceedings . This helps ensure a balanced presentation of different perspectives on the issues, but it is also likely to discourage later cooperation and heighten animosities between contesting parties if \"winners\" and \"losers\" emerge.  </li></ul><h3>Client-centered [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Client-centered studies address specific concerns and issues of practitioners and other clients of the study in a particular setting. These studies help people understand the activities and values involved from a variety of perspectives. However, this responsive approach can lead to low external credibility and a favorable bias toward those who participated in the study.  </li></ul><h2>Methods and techniques [ edit ]  </h2><p>Evaluation is methodologically diverse.

Important principles of this ideology include freedom of choice, the uniqueness of the individual and empirical inquiry grounded in objectivity . He also contends that they are all based on subjectivist ethics, in which ethical conduct is based on the subjective or intuitive experience of an individual or group. One form of subjectivist ethics is utilitarian , in which \" the good \" is determined by what maximizes a single, explicit interpretation of happiness for society as a whole. Another form of subjectivist ethics is intuitionist / pluralist , in which no single interpretation of \"the good\" is assumed and such interpretations need not be explicitly stated nor justified.  </p><p>These ethical positions have corresponding epistemologies — philosophies for obtaining knowledge . The objectivist epistemology is associated with the utilitarian ethic; in general, it is used to acquire knowledge that can be externally verified (intersubjective agreement) through publicly exposed methods and data . The subjectivist epistemology is associated with the intuitionist/pluralist ethic and is used to acquire new knowledge based on existing personal knowledge, as well as experiences that are (explicit) or are not (tacit) available for public inspection.

The political orientation promotes a positive or negative view of an object regardless of what its value actually is and might be—they call this pseudo-evaluation .

The values orientation includes approaches primarily intended to determine the value of an object—they call this true evaluation.  </p><p>When the above concepts are considered simultaneously, fifteen evaluation approaches can be identified in terms of epistemology, major perspective (from House), and orientation. Two pseudo-evaluation approaches, politically controlled and public relations studies, are represented. They are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Six quasi-evaluation approaches use an objectivist epistemology. Five of them— experimental research, management information systems , testing programs, objectives-based studies, and content analysis —take an elite perspective. Accountability takes a mass perspective. Seven true evaluation approaches are included. Two approaches, decision-oriented and policy studies, are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Consumer-oriented studies are based on an objectivist epistemology from a mass perspective. Two approaches—accreditation/certification and connoisseur studies—are based on a subjectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Finally, adversary and client-centered studies are based on a subjectivist epistemology from a mass perspective.  </p><h3>Summary of approaches [ edit ]  </h3><p>The following table is used to summarize each approach in terms of four attributes —organizer, purpose, strengths, and weaknesses. The organizer represents the main considerations or cues practitioners use to organize a study. The purpose represents the desired outcome for a study at a very general level. Strengths and weaknesses represent other attributes that should be considered when deciding whether to use the approach for a particular study. The following narrative highlights differences between approaches grouped together. Summary of approaches for conducting evaluations Approach Attribute Organizer Purpose Key strengths Key weaknesses Politically controlled Threats Get, keep or increase influence, power or money. Secure evidence advantageous to the client in a conflict. Violates the principle of full &amp; frank disclosure. Public relations Propaganda needs Create positive public image. Secure evidence most likely to bolster public support. Violates the principles of balanced reporting, justified conclusions, &amp; objectivity. Experimental research Causal relationships Determine causal relationships between variables. Strongest paradigm for determining causal relationships. Requires controlled setting, limits range of evidence, focuses primarily on results. Management information systems Scientific efficiency Continuously supply evidence needed to fund, direct, &amp; control programs. Gives managers detailed evidence about complex programs. Human service variables are rarely amenable to the narrow, quantitative definitions needed. Testing programs Individual differences Compare test scores of individuals &amp; groups to selected norms. Produces valid &amp; reliable evidence in many performance areas. Very familiar to public. Data usually only on testee performance, overemphasizes test-taking skills, can be poor sample of what is taught or expected. Objectives -based Objectives Relates outcomes to objectives. Common sense appeal, widely used, uses behavioral objectives &amp; testing technologies. Leads to terminal evidence often too narrow to provide basis for judging the value of a program. Content analysis Content of a communication Describe &amp; draw conclusion about a communication. Allows for unobtrusive analysis of large volumes of unstructured, symbolic materials. Sample may be unrepresentative yet overwhelming in volume. Analysis design often overly simplistic for question. Accountability Performance expectations Provide constituents with an accurate accounting of results. Popular with constituents. Aimed at improving quality of products and services. Creates unrest between practitioners &amp; consumers. Politics often forces premature studies. Decision -oriented Decisions Provide a knowledge &amp; value base for making &amp; defending decisions. Encourages use of evaluation to plan &amp; implement needed programs. Helps justify decisions about plans &amp; actions. Necessary collaboration between evaluator &amp; decision-maker provides opportunity to bias results. Policy studies Broad issues Identify and assess potential costs &amp; benefits of competing policies. Provide general direction for broadly focused actions. Often corrupted or subverted by politically motivated actions of participants. Consumer -oriented Generalized needs &amp; values, effects Judge the relative merits of alternative goods &amp; services. Independent appraisal to protect practitioners &amp; consumers from shoddy products &amp; services. High public credibility. Might not help practitioners do a better job. Requires credible &amp; competent evaluators. Accreditation / certification Standards &amp; guidelines Determine if institutions, programs, &amp; personnel should be approved to perform specified functions. Helps public make informed decisions about quality of organizations &amp; qualifications of personnel. Standards &amp; guidelines typically emphasize intrinsic criteria to the exclusion of outcome measures. Connoisseur Critical guideposts Critically describe, appraise, &amp; illuminate an object. Exploits highly developed expertise on subject of interest. Can inspire others to more insightful efforts. Dependent on small number of experts, making evaluation susceptible to subjectivity, bias, and corruption. Adversary Evaluation \"Hot\" issues Present the pro &amp; cons of an issue. Ensures balances presentations of represented perspectives. Can discourage cooperation, heighten animosities. Client-centered Specific concerns &amp; issues Foster understanding of activities &amp; how they are valued in a given setting &amp; from a variety of perspectives. Practitioners are helped to conduct their own evaluation. Low external credibility, susceptible to bias in favor of participants. Note. Adapted and condensed primarily from House (1978) and Stufflebeam &amp; Webster (1980).  </p><h3>Pseudo-evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><p>Politically controlled and public relations studies are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. <sup>[ clarification needed ] </sup>Although both of these approaches seek to misrepresent value interpretations about an object, they function differently from each other. Information obtained through politically controlled studies is released or withheld to meet the special interests of the holder, whereas public relations information creates a positive image of an object regardless of the actual situation. Despite the application of both studies in real scenarios, neither of these approaches is acceptable evaluation practice.  </p><h3>Objectivist, elite, quasi-evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><p>As a group, these five approaches represent a highly respected collection of disciplined inquiry approaches. They are considered quasi-evaluation approaches because particular studies legitimately can focus only on questions of knowledge without addressing any questions of value. Such studies are, by definition, not evaluations. These approaches can produce characterizations without producing appraisals, although specific studies can produce both. Each of these approaches serves its intended purpose well. They are discussed roughly in order of the extent to which they approach the objectivist ideal.  </p><ul><li>Experimental research is the best approach for determining causal relationships between variables . The potential problem with using this as an evaluation approach is that its highly controlled and stylized methodology may not be sufficiently responsive to the dynamically changing needs of most human service programs.  </li><li>Management information systems (MISs) can give detailed information about the dynamic operations of complex programs. However, this information is restricted to readily quantifiable data usually available at regular intervals.  </li><li>Testing programs are familiar to just about anyone who has attended school, served in the military, or worked for a large company. These programs are good at comparing individuals or groups to selected norms in a number of subject areas or to a set of standards of performance. However, they only focus on testee performance and they might not adequately sample what is taught or expected.  </li><li>Objectives -based approaches relate outcomes to prespecified objectives, allowing judgments to be made about their level of attainment. Unfortunately, the objectives are often not proven to be important or they focus on outcomes too narrow to provide the basis for determining the value of an object.  </li><li>Content analysis is a quasi-evaluation approach because content analysis judgments need not be based on value statements. Instead, they can be based on knowledge. Such content analyses are not evaluations. On the other hand, when content analysis judgments are based on values, such studies are evaluations.  </li></ul><h3>Objectivist, mass, quasi-evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Accountability is popular with constituents because it is intended to provide an accurate accounting of results that can improve the quality of products and services . However, this approach quickly can turn practitioners and consumers into adversaries when implemented in a heavy-handed fashion.  </li></ul><h3>Objectivist, elite, true evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Decision -oriented studies are designed to provide a knowledge base for making and defending decisions. This approach usually requires the close collaboration between an evaluator and decision-maker, allowing it to be susceptible to corruption and bias .  </li><li>Policy studies provide general guidance and direction on broad issues by identifying and assessing potential costs and benefits of competing policies . The drawback is these studies can be corrupted or subverted by the politically motivated actions of the participants.  </li></ul><h3>Objectivist, mass, true evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Consumer -oriented studies are used to judge the relative merits of goods and services based on generalized needs and values, along with a comprehensive range of effects. However, this approach does not necessarily help practitioners improve their work, and it requires a very good and credible evaluator to do it well.  </li></ul><h3>Subjectivist, elite, true evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Accreditation / certification programs are based on self-study and peer review of organizations, programs, and personnel. They draw on the insights, experience, and expertise of qualified individuals who use established guidelines to determine if the applicant should be approved to perform specified functions. However, unless performance-based standards are used, attributes of applicants and the processes they perform often are overemphasized in relation to measures of outcomes or effects.  </li><li>Connoisseur studies use the highly refined skills of individuals intimately familiar with the subject of the evaluation to critically characterize and appraise it. This approach can help others see programs in a new light, but it is difficult to find a qualified and unbiased connoisseur.  </li></ul><h3>Subject, mass, true evaluation [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>The adversary approach focuses on drawing out the pros and cons of controversial issues through quasi- legal proceedings . This helps ensure a balanced presentation of different perspectives on the issues, but it is also likely to discourage later cooperation and heighten animosities between contesting parties if \"winners\" and \"losers\" emerge.  </li></ul><h3>Client-centered [ edit ]  </h3><ul><li>Client-centered studies address specific concerns and issues of practitioners and other clients of the study in a particular setting. These studies help people understand the activities and values involved from a variety of perspectives. However, this responsive approach can lead to low external credibility and a favorable bias toward those who participated in the study.  </li></ul><h2>Methods and techniques [ edit ]  </h2><p>Evaluation is methodologically diverse.

            "source: <p></p><h1>Evaluation  </h1><p>Evaluation is a systematic determination of a subject's merit, worth and significance, using criteria governed by a set of standards . It can assist an organization, program, design, project or any other intervention or initiative to assess any aim, realisable concept/proposal, or any alternative, to help in decision-making ; or to ascertain the degree of achievement or value in regard to the aim and objectives and results of any such action that has been completed. The primary purpose of evaluation, in addition to gaining insight into prior or existing initiatives, is to enable reflection and assist in the identification of future change. Evaluation is often used to characterize and appraise subjects of interest in a wide range of human enterprises, including the arts , criminal justice , foundations , non-profit organizations , government , health care , and other human services. It is long term and done at the end of a period of time.  </p><h2>Definition [ edit ]  </h2><p>Evaluation is the structured interpretation and giving of meaning to predicted or actual impacts of proposals or results. It looks at original objectives, and at what is either predicted or what was accomplished and how it was accomplished. So evaluation can be formative , that is taking place during the development of a concept or proposal, project or organization, with the intention of improving the value or effectiveness of the proposal, project, or organisation. It can also be summative , drawing lessons from a completed action or project or an organisation at a later point in time or circumstance.  </p><p>Evaluation is inherently a theoretically informed approach (whether explicitly or not), and consequently any particular definition of evaluation would have been tailored to its context – the theory, needs, purpose, and methodology of the evaluation process itself. Having said this, evaluation has been defined as:  </p><ul><li>A systematic, rigorous, and meticulous application of scientific methods to assess the design, implementation, improvement, or outcomes of a program. It is a resource-intensive process, frequently requiring resources, such as, evaluate expertise, labor, time, and a sizable budget  </li><li>\"The critical assessment, in as objective a manner as possible, of the degree to which a service or its component parts fulfills stated goals\" (St Leger and Wordsworth-Bell). <sup>[ failed verification ] </sup>The focus of this definition is on attaining objective knowledge, and scientifically or quantitatively measuring predetermined and external concepts.  </li><li>\"A study designed to assist some audience to assess an object's merit and worth\" (Stufflebeam). <sup>[ failed verification ] </sup>In this definition the focus is on facts as well as value laden judgments of the programs outcomes and worth.  </li></ul><h3>Purpose [ edit ]  </h3><p>The main purpose of a program evaluation can be to \"determine the quality of a program by formulating a judgment\" Marthe Hurteau, Sylvain Houle, Stéphanie Mongiat (2009). An alternative view is that \"projects, evaluators, and other stakeholders (including funders) will all have potentially different ideas about how best to evaluate a project since each may have a different definition of 'merit'. The core of the problem is thus about defining what is of value.\" From this perspective, evaluation \"is a contested term\", as \"evaluators\" use the term evaluation to describe an assessment, or investigation of a program whilst others simply understand evaluation as being synonymous with applied research.  </p><p>There are two function considering to the evaluation purpose Formative Evaluations provide the information on the improving a product or a process Summative Evaluations provide information of short-term effectiveness or long-term impact to deciding the adoption of a product or process.  </p><p>Not all evaluations serve the same purpose some evaluations serve a monitoring function rather than focusing solely on measurable program outcomes or evaluation findings and a full list of types of evaluations would be difficult to compile. This is because evaluation is not part of a unified theoretical framework, drawing on a number of disciplines, which include management and organisational theory , policy analysis , education , sociology , social anthropology , and social change .  </p><h3>Discussion [ edit ]  </h3><p>However, the strict adherence to a set of methodological assumptions may make the field of evaluation more acceptable to a mainstream audience but this adherence will work towards preventing evaluators from developing new strategies for dealing with the myriad problems that programs face. It is claimed that only a minority of evaluation reports are used by the evaluand (client) (Datta, 2006). One justification of this is that \"when evaluation findings are challenged or utilization has failed, it was because stakeholders and clients found the inferences weak or the warrants unconvincing\" (Fournier and Smith, 1993). Some reasons for this situation may be the failure of the evaluator to establish a set of shared aims with the evaluand, or creating overly ambitious aims, as well as failing to compromise and incorporate the cultural differences of individuals and programs within the evaluation aims and process. None of these problems are due to a lack of a definition of evaluation but are rather due to evaluators attempting to impose predisposed notions and definitions of evaluations on clients. The central reason for the poor utilization of evaluations is arguably <sup>[ by whom? ] </sup>due to the lack of tailoring of evaluations to suit the needs of the client, due to a predefined idea (or definition) of what an evaluation is rather than what the client needs are (House, 1980). The development of a standard methodology for evaluation will require arriving at applicable ways of asking and stating the results of questions about ethics such as agent-principal, privacy, stakeholder definition, limited liability; and could-the-money-be-spent-more-wisely issues.  </p><h2>Standards [ edit ]  </h2><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png\"/><p>Depending on the topic of interest, there are professional groups that review the quality and rigor of evaluation processes.  </p><p>Evaluating programs and projects, regarding their value and impact within the context they are implemented, can be ethically challenging. Evaluators may encounter complex, culturally specific systems resistant to external evaluation. Furthermore, the project organization or other stakeholders may be invested in a particular evaluation outcome. Finally, evaluators themselves may encounter \" conflict of interest (COI) \" issues, or experience interference or pressure to present findings that support a particular assessment.  </p><p>General professional codes of conduct , as determined by the employing organization, usually cover three broad aspects of behavioral standards, and include inter- collegial relations (such as respect for diversity and privacy ), operational issues (due competence , documentation accuracy and appropriate use of resources), and conflicts of interest ( nepotism , accepting gifts and other kinds of favoritism). However, specific guidelines particular to the evaluator's role that can be utilized in the management of unique ethical challenges are required. The Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation has developed standards for program, personnel, and student evaluation. The Joint Committee standards are broken into four sections: Utility, Feasibility, Propriety, and Accuracy. Various European institutions have also prepared their own standards, more or less related to those produced by the Joint Committee. They provide guidelines about basing value judgments on systematic inquiry, evaluator competence and integrity, respect for people, and regard for the general and public welfare.  </p><p>The American Evaluation Association has created a set of Guiding Principles for evaluators. The order of these principles does not imply priority among them; priority will vary by situation and evaluator role. The principles run as follows:  </p><ul><li>Systematic Inquiry : evaluators conduct systematic, data -based inquiries about whatever is being evaluated. This requires quality data collection, including a defensible choice of indicators, which lends credibility to findings. Findings are credible when they are demonstrably evidence-based, reliable and valid. This also pertains to the choice of methodology employed, such that it is consistent with the aims of the evaluation and provides dependable data. Furthermore, utility of findings is critical such that the information obtained by evaluation is comprehensive and timely, and thus serves to provide maximal benefit and use to stakeholders .  </li><li>Competence: evaluators provide competent performance to stakeholders . This requires that evaluation teams comprise an appropriate combination of competencies, such that varied and appropriate expertise is available for the evaluation process, and that evaluators work within their scope of capability.  </li><li>Integrity / Honesty : evaluators ensure the honesty and integrity of the entire evaluation process. A key element of this principle is freedom from bias in evaluation and this is underscored by three principles: impartiality, independence, and transparency.  </li></ul><blockquote></blockquote><p>Independence is attained through ensuring independence of judgment is upheld such that evaluation conclusions are not influenced or pressured by another party, and avoidance of conflict of interest, such that the evaluator does not have a stake in a particular conclusion.

            "source: <p></p><h1>Evaluation  </h1><p>Evaluation is a systematic determination of a subject's merit, worth and significance, using criteria governed by a set of standards . It can assist an organization, program, design, project or any other intervention or initiative to assess any aim, realisable concept/proposal, or any alternative, to help in decision-making ; or to ascertain the degree of achievement or value in regard to the aim and objectives and results of any such action that has been completed. The primary purpose of evaluation, in addition to gaining insight into prior or existing initiatives, is to enable reflection and assist in the identification of future change. Evaluation is often used to characterize and appraise subjects of interest in a wide range of human enterprises, including the arts , criminal justice , foundations , non-profit organizations , government , health care , and other human services. It is long term and done at the end of a period of time.  </p><h2>Definition [ edit ]  </h2><p>Evaluation is the structured interpretation and giving of meaning to predicted or actual impacts of proposals or results. It looks at original objectives, and at what is either predicted or what was accomplished and how it was accomplished. So evaluation can be formative , that is taking place during the development of a concept or proposal, project or organization, with the intention of improving the value or effectiveness of the proposal, project, or organisation. It can also be summative , drawing lessons from a completed action or project or an organisation at a later point in time or circumstance.  </p><p>Evaluation is inherently a theoretically informed approach (whether explicitly or not), and consequently any particular definition of evaluation would have been tailored to its context – the theory, needs, purpose, and methodology of the evaluation process itself. Having said this, evaluation has been defined as:  </p><ul><li>A systematic, rigorous, and meticulous application of scientific methods to assess the design, implementation, improvement, or outcomes of a program. It is a resource-intensive process, frequently requiring resources, such as, evaluate expertise, labor, time, and a sizable budget  </li><li>\"The critical assessment, in as objective a manner as possible, of the degree to which a service or its component parts fulfills stated goals\" (St Leger and Wordsworth-Bell). <sup>[ failed verification ] </sup>The focus of this definition is on attaining objective knowledge, and scientifically or quantitatively measuring predetermined and external concepts.  </li><li>\"A study designed to assist some audience to assess an object's merit and worth\" (Stufflebeam). <sup>[ failed verification ] </sup>In this definition the focus is on facts as well as value laden judgments of the programs outcomes and worth.  </li></ul><h3>Purpose [ edit ]  </h3><p>The main purpose of a program evaluation can be to \"determine the quality of a program by formulating a judgment\" Marthe Hurteau, Sylvain Houle, Stéphanie Mongiat (2009). An alternative view is that \"projects, evaluators, and other stakeholders (including funders) will all have potentially different ideas about how best to evaluate a project since each may have a different definition of 'merit'. The core of the problem is thus about defining what is of value.\" From this perspective, evaluation \"is a contested term\", as \"evaluators\" use the term evaluation to describe an assessment, or investigation of a program whilst others simply understand evaluation as being synonymous with applied research.  </p><p>There are two function considering to the evaluation purpose Formative Evaluations provide the information on the improving a product or a process Summative Evaluations provide information of short-term effectiveness or long-term impact to deciding the adoption of a product or process.  </p><p>Not all evaluations serve the same purpose some evaluations serve a monitoring function rather than focusing solely on measurable program outcomes or evaluation findings and a full list of types of evaluations would be difficult to compile. This is because evaluation is not part of a unified theoretical framework, drawing on a number of disciplines, which include management and organisational theory , policy analysis , education , sociology , social anthropology , and social change .  </p><h3>Discussion [ edit ]  </h3><p>However, the strict adherence to a set of methodological assumptions may make the field of evaluation more acceptable to a mainstream audience but this adherence will work towards preventing evaluators from developing new strategies for dealing with the myriad problems that programs face. It is claimed that only a minority of evaluation reports are used by the evaluand (client) (Datta, 2006). One justification of this is that \"when evaluation findings are challenged or utilization has failed, it was because stakeholders and clients found the inferences weak or the warrants unconvincing\" (Fournier and Smith, 1993). Some reasons for this situation may be the failure of the evaluator to establish a set of shared aims with the evaluand, or creating overly ambitious aims, as well as failing to compromise and incorporate the cultural differences of individuals and programs within the evaluation aims and process. None of these problems are due to a lack of a definition of evaluation but are rather due to evaluators attempting to impose predisposed notions and definitions of evaluations on clients. The central reason for the poor utilization of evaluations is arguably <sup>[ by whom? ] </sup>due to the lack of tailoring of evaluations to suit the needs of the client, due to a predefined idea (or definition) of what an evaluation is rather than what the client needs are (House, 1980). The development of a standard methodology for evaluation will require arriving at applicable ways of asking and stating the results of questions about ethics such as agent-principal, privacy, stakeholder definition, limited liability; and could-the-money-be-spent-more-wisely issues.  </p><h2>Standards [ edit ]  </h2><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png\"/><p>Depending on the topic of interest, there are professional groups that review the quality and rigor of evaluation processes.  </p><p>Evaluating programs and projects, regarding their value and impact within the context they are implemented, can be ethically challenging. Evaluators may encounter complex, culturally specific systems resistant to external evaluation. Furthermore, the project organization or other stakeholders may be invested in a particular evaluation outcome. Finally, evaluators themselves may encounter \" conflict of interest (COI) \" issues, or experience interference or pressure to present findings that support a particular assessment.  </p><p>General professional codes of conduct , as determined by the employing organization, usually cover three broad aspects of behavioral standards, and include inter- collegial relations (such as respect for diversity and privacy ), operational issues (due competence , documentation accuracy and appropriate use of resources), and conflicts of interest ( nepotism , accepting gifts and other kinds of favoritism). However, specific guidelines particular to the evaluator's role that can be utilized in the management of unique ethical challenges are required. The Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation has developed standards for program, personnel, and student evaluation. The Joint Committee standards are broken into four sections: Utility, Feasibility, Propriety, and Accuracy. Various European institutions have also prepared their own standards, more or less related to those produced by the Joint Committee. They provide guidelines about basing value judgments on systematic inquiry, evaluator competence and integrity, respect for people, and regard for the general and public welfare.  </p><p>The American Evaluation Association has created a set of Guiding Principles for evaluators. The order of these principles does not imply priority among them; priority will vary by situation and evaluator role. The principles run as follows:  </p><ul><li>Systematic Inquiry : evaluators conduct systematic, data -based inquiries about whatever is being evaluated. This requires quality data collection, including a defensible choice of indicators, which lends credibility to findings. Findings are credible when they are demonstrably evidence-based, reliable and valid. This also pertains to the choice of methodology employed, such that it is consistent with the aims of the evaluation and provides dependable data. Furthermore, utility of findings is critical such that the information obtained by evaluation is comprehensive and timely, and thus serves to provide maximal benefit and use to stakeholders .  </li><li>Competence: evaluators provide competent performance to stakeholders . This requires that evaluation teams comprise an appropriate combination of competencies, such that varied and appropriate expertise is available for the evaluation process, and that evaluators work within their scope of capability.  </li><li>Integrity / Honesty : evaluators ensure the honesty and integrity of the entire evaluation process. A key element of this principle is freedom from bias in evaluation and this is underscored by three principles: impartiality, independence, and transparency.  </li></ul><blockquote></blockquote><p>Independence is attained through ensuring independence of judgment is upheld such that evaluation conclusions are not influenced or pressured by another party, and avoidance of conflict of interest, such that the evaluator does not have a stake in a particular conclusion. Conflict of interest is at issue particularly where funding of evaluations is provided by particular bodies with a stake in conclusions of the evaluation, and this is seen as potentially compromising the independence of the evaluator. Whilst it is acknowledged that evaluators may be familiar with agencies or projects that they are required to evaluate, independence requires that they not have been involved in the planning or implementation of the project. A declaration of interest should be made where any benefits or association with project are stated. Independence of judgment is required to be maintained against any pressures brought to bear on evaluators, for example, by project funders wishing to modify evaluations such that the project appears more effective than  </p><p>findings can verify.  </p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Impartiality pertains to findings being a fair and thorough assessment of strengths and weaknesses of a project or program. This requires taking due input from all stakeholders involved and findings presented without bias and with a transparent, proportionate, and persuasive link between findings and recommendations. Thus evaluators are required to delimit their findings to evidence. A mechanism to ensure impartiality is external and internal review. Such review is required of significant (determined in terms of cost or sensitivity) evaluations. The review is based on quality of work and the degree to which a demonstrable link is provided between findings  </p><p>and recommendations.  </p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Transparency requires that stakeholders are aware of the reason for the evaluation, the criteria by which evaluation occurs and the purposes to which the findings will be applied. Access to the evaluation document should be facilitated through findings being easily readable, with clear explanations of evaluation methodologies, approaches, sources of information, and costs  </p><p>incurred.  </p><ul><li>Respect for People: Evaluators respect the security , dignity and self-worth of the respondents, program participants , clients , and other stakeholders with whom they interact .This is particularly pertinent with regards to those who will be impacted upon by the evaluation findings. Protection of people includes ensuring informed consent from those involved in the evaluation, upholding confidentiality, and ensuring that the identity of those who may provide sensitive information towards the program evaluation is protected. Evaluators are ethically required to respect the customs and beliefs of those who are impacted upon by the evaluation or program activities. Examples of how such respect is demonstrated is through respecting local customs e.g. dress codes, respecting peoples privacy, and minimizing demands on others' time. Where stakeholders wish to place objections to evaluation findings, such a process should be facilitated through the local office of the evaluation organization, and procedures for lodging complaints or queries should be accessible and clear.  </li><li>Responsibilities for General and Public Welfare : Evaluators articulate and take into account the diversity of interests and values that may be related to the general and public welfare. Access to evaluation documents by the wider public should be facilitated such that discussion and feedback is enabled.  </li></ul><p>Furthermore, the international organizations such as the I.M.F. and the World Bank have independent evaluation functions. The various funds, programmes, and agencies of the United Nations has a mix of independent, semi-independent and self-evaluation functions, which have organized themselves as a system-wide UN Evaluation Group (UNEG), that works together to strengthen the function, and to establish UN norms and standards for evaluation. There is also an evaluation group within the OECD-DAC, which endeavors to improve development evaluation standards. The independent evaluation units of the major multinational development banks (MDBs) have also created the Evaluation Cooperation Group to strengthen the use of evaluation for greater MDB effectiveness and accountability, share lessons from MDB evaluations, and promote evaluation harmonization and collaboration.  </p><h2>Perspectives [ edit ]  </h2><p>The word \"evaluation\" has various connotations for different people, raising issues related to this process that include; what type of evaluation should be conducted; why there should be an evaluation process and how the evaluation is integrated into a program, for the purpose of gaining greater knowledge and awareness? There are also various factors inherent in the evaluation process, for example; to critically examine influences within a program that involve the gathering and analyzing of relative information about a program.  </p><p>Michael Quinn Patton motivated the concept that the evaluation procedure should be directed towards:  </p><p>Founded on another perspective of evaluation by Thomson and Hoffman in 2003, it is possible for a situation to be encountered, in which the process could not be considered advisable; for instance, in the event of a program being unpredictable, or unsound. This would include it lacking a consistent routine; or the concerned parties unable to reach an agreement regarding the purpose of the program. In addition, an influencer, or manager, refusing to incorporate relevant, important central issues within the evaluation  </p><h2>Approaches [ edit ]  </h2><p>There exist several conceptually distinct ways of thinking about, designing, and conducting evaluation efforts. Many of the evaluation approaches in use today make truly unique contributions to solving important problems, while others refine existing approaches in some way.  </p><h3>Classification of approaches [ edit ]  </h3><p>Two classifications of evaluation approaches by House and Stufflebeam and Webster can be combined into a manageable number of approaches in terms of their unique and important underlying principles. <sup>[ clarification needed ] </sup></p><p>House considers all major evaluation approaches to be based on a common ideology entitled liberal democracy . Important principles of this ideology include freedom of choice, the uniqueness of the individual and empirical inquiry grounded in objectivity . He also contends that they are all based on subjectivist ethics, in which ethical conduct is based on the subjective or intuitive experience of an individual or group. One form of subjectivist ethics is utilitarian , in which \" the good \" is determined by what maximizes a single, explicit interpretation of happiness for society as a whole. Another form of subjectivist ethics is intuitionist / pluralist , in which no single interpretation of \"the good\" is assumed and such interpretations need not be explicitly stated nor justified.  </p><p>These ethical positions have corresponding epistemologies — philosophies for obtaining knowledge . The objectivist epistemology is associated with the utilitarian ethic; in general, it is used to acquire knowledge that can be externally verified (intersubjective agreement) through publicly exposed methods and data . The subjectivist epistemology is associated with the intuitionist/pluralist ethic and is used to acquire new knowledge based on existing personal knowledge, as well as experiences that are (explicit) or are not (tacit) available for public inspection. House then divides each epistemological approach into two main political perspectives. Firstly, approaches can take an elite perspective, focusing on the interests of managers and professionals; or they also can take a mass perspective, focusing on consumers and participatory approaches.  </p><p>Stufflebeam and Webster place approaches into one of three groups, according to their orientation toward the role of values and ethical consideration. The political orientation promotes a positive or negative view of an object regardless of what its value actually is and might be—they call this pseudo-evaluation . The questions orientation includes approaches that might or might not provide answers specifically related to the value of an object—they call this quasi -evaluation. The values orientation includes approaches primarily intended to determine the value of an object—they call this true evaluation.  </p><p>When the above concepts are considered simultaneously, fifteen evaluation approaches can be identified in terms of epistemology, major perspective (from House), and orientation. Two pseudo-evaluation approaches, politically controlled and public relations studies, are represented. They are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Six quasi-evaluation approaches use an objectivist epistemology. Five of them— experimental research, management information systems , testing programs, objectives-based studies, and content analysis —take an elite perspective. Accountability takes a mass perspective. Seven true evaluation approaches are included. Two approaches, decision-oriented and policy studies, are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Consumer-oriented studies are based on an objectivist epistemology from a mass perspective. Two approaches—accreditation/certification and connoisseur studies—are based on a subjectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Finally, adversary and client-centered studies are based on a subjectivist epistemology from a mass perspective.  </p><h3>Summary of approaches [ edit ]  </h3><p>The following table is used to summarize each approach in terms of four attributes —organizer, purpose, strengths, and weaknesses.

Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/1.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/2.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/3.png\"/><p>Fig 2. Methodology flowchart.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/4.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/5.png\"/><h2>Results  </h2><h2>Feature extraction and selection  </h2><p>In this section, we provide details of the data setup, the usage of the LDA algorithm, the feature correlation analysis, the feature selection process, and the development of a prediction model. Features that most significantly influence funding success. In what follows we describe the war in which we faund the featurec that are mact influential far BS We need turn methnade a a the way in which we found the features that are most influential for FS. We used two methods The first is the Pearson correlation between the independent features and the dependent feature (i.e., the FS). The second is the CFS algorithm. , oe aa a, aa Features that highly correlate with funding success. Below in Table 1, for each of the three datasets, we list the 10 features for which the highest correlation values to FS were derived. The semantics of features annotated with * are provided in LIWC documentation (R_AILD stands for Ranked features from All_D). Feature selection. We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset. The CFS algorithm evaluates subsets of features based on the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. The following are the algorithm’s results. MSSF from All_D (S_ All_D):  </p><h2>* punc*  </h2><p>From the above results, we conclude that there are various semantic features that have a high correlation to FS among the features we checked based on the project’s category. Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/6.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/7.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare. The Figure shows that the model we developed has the highest accuracy. The accuracy of the Semantic-Model is similar to the accuracy of the LDA-Model and higher than the accuracy of the  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/8.png\"/><h2>Conclusion and future work  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been offering entrepreneurs the possibility to present their projects and attract funders, and thus raise the funds necessary for their projects. The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/9.png\"/><p>Fig 3. Comparison of models’ accuracy.  </p><p>from previous studies. We have shown that the category of the project influences the features that have a high correlation with funding success. We offer (example) for technological projects, as follows: + Entrepreneurs should update their project information during the funding period. + The project’s post should contain more feelings words. While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p><h2></h2> \n",

Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/1.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/2.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/3.png\"/><p>Fig 2.

Features that most significantly influence funding success. In what follows we describe the war in which we faund the featurec that are mact influential far BS We need turn methnade a a the way in which we found the features that are most influential for FS. We used two methods The first is the Pearson correlation between the independent features and the dependent feature (i.e., the FS). The second is the CFS algorithm. , oe aa a, aa Features that highly correlate with funding success. Below in Table 1, for each of the three datasets, we list the 10 features for which the highest correlation values to FS were derived. The semantics of features annotated with * are provided in LIWC documentation (R_AILD stands for Ranked features from All_D). Feature selection. We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset. The CFS algorithm evaluates subsets of features based on the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. The following are the algorithm’s results. MSSF from All_D (S_ All_D):  </p><h2>* punc*  </h2><p>From the above results, we conclude that there are various semantic features that have a high correlation to FS among the features we checked based on the project’s category. Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/6.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/7.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare. The Figure shows that the model we developed has the highest accuracy.

The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/9.png\"/><p>Fig 3.

We offer (example) for technological projects, as follows: + Entrepreneurs should update their project information during the funding period. + The project’s post should contain more feelings words. While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p><h2></h2> \n",

Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. .

Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/1.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/2.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/3.png\"/><p>Fig 2. Methodology flowchart.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/4.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/5.png\"/><h2>Results  </h2><h2>Feature extraction and selection  </h2><p>In this section, we provide details of the data setup, the usage of the LDA algorithm, the feature correlation analysis, the feature selection process, and the development of a prediction model. Features that most significantly influence funding success. In what follows we describe the war in which we faund the featurec that are mact influential far BS We need turn methnade a a the way in which we found the features that are most influential for FS. We used two methods The first is the Pearson correlation between the independent features and the dependent feature (i.e., the FS). The second is the CFS algorithm. , oe aa a, aa Features that highly correlate with funding success. Below in Table 1, for each of the three datasets, we list the 10 features for which the highest correlation values to FS were derived. The semantics of features annotated with * are provided in LIWC documentation (R_AILD stands for Ranked features from All_D). Feature selection. We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset. The CFS algorithm evaluates subsets of features based on the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. The following are the algorithm’s results. MSSF from All_D (S_ All_D):  </p><h2>* punc*  </h2><p>From the above results, we conclude that there are various semantic features that have a high correlation to FS among the features we checked based on the project’s category. Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/6.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/7.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare. The Figure shows that the model we developed has the highest accuracy. The accuracy of the Semantic-Model is similar to the accuracy of the LDA-Model and higher than the accuracy of the  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/8.png\"/><h2>Conclusion and future work  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been offering entrepreneurs the possibility to present their projects and attract funders, and thus raise the funds necessary for their projects. The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/9.png\"/><p>Fig 3. Comparison of models’ accuracy.  </p><p>from previous studies. We have shown that the category of the project influences the features that have a high correlation with funding success. We offer (example) for technological projects, as follows: + Entrepreneurs should update their project information during the funding period. + The project’s post should contain more feelings words. While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p><h2></h2> \n",

Hence, the question of what influences projects’ fundraising success is very important. Previous studies examined various factors such as project goals and project duration that may influence the outcomes of fundraising campaigns. We present a novel model for predicting the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. Our model focuses on semantic features only, whose performance is comparable to that of previous models. In an additional model we developed, we examine both project metadata and project semantics, delivering a comprehensive study of factors influencing crowdfunding success. Further, we analyze a large dataset of crowdfunding project data, larger than reportec in the art. Finally, we show that when combining semantics and metadata, we arrive at F1 score accuracy of 96.2%. We compare our model's accuracy to the accuracy of previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset, and demonstrate higher accuracy of our model. In addition to our scientific contribution, we provide practical recommendations that may increase project funding success chances.  </p><h2>Introduction  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding has emerged as a popular financing mechanism that allows various types of projects to get funded. Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/1.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/2.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/3.png\"/><p>Fig 2.

Features that most significantly influence funding success. In what follows we describe the war in which we faund the featurec that are mact influential far BS We need turn methnade a a the way in which we found the features that are most influential for FS. We used two methods The first is the Pearson correlation between the independent features and the dependent feature (i.e., the FS).

Below in Table 1, for each of the three datasets, we list the 10 features for which the highest correlation values to FS were derived. The semantics of features annotated with * are provided in LIWC documentation (R_AILD stands for Ranked features from All_D). Feature selection. We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset.

Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/6.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/7.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare. The Figure shows that the model we developed has the highest accuracy. The accuracy of the Semantic-Model is similar to the accuracy of the LDA-Model and higher than the accuracy of the  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/8.png\"/><h2>Conclusion and future work  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been offering entrepreneurs the possibility to present their projects and attract funders, and thus raise the funds necessary for their projects. The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/9.png\"/><p>Fig 3. Comparison of models’ accuracy.  </p><p>from previous studies. We have shown that the category of the project influences the features that have a high correlation with funding success. We offer (example) for technological projects, as follows: + Entrepreneurs should update their project information during the funding period. + The project’s post should contain more feelings words. While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p><h2></h2> \n",

Hence, the question of what influences projects’ fundraising success is very important. Previous studies examined various factors such as project goals and project duration that may influence the outcomes of fundraising campaigns. We present a novel model for predicting the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. Our model focuses on semantic features only, whose performance is comparable to that of previous models. In an additional model we developed, we examine both project metadata and project semantics, delivering a comprehensive study of factors influencing crowdfunding success. Further, we analyze a large dataset of crowdfunding project data, larger than reportec in the art. Finally, we show that when combining semantics and metadata, we arrive at F1 score accuracy of 96.2%. We compare our model's accuracy to the accuracy of previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset, and demonstrate higher accuracy of our model. In addition to our scientific contribution, we provide practical recommendations that may increase project funding success chances.  </p><h2>Introduction  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding has emerged as a popular financing mechanism that allows various types of projects to get funded. Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/1.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/2.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/3.png\"/><p>Fig 2.

Features that most significantly influence funding success. In what follows we describe the war in which we faund the featurec that are mact influential far BS We need turn methnade a a the way in which we found the features that are most influential for FS.

We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset. The CFS algorithm evaluates subsets of features based on the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. The following are the algorithm’s results.

Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/6.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/7.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare. The Figure shows that the model we developed has the highest accuracy.

The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/9.png\"/><p>Fig 3. Comparison of models’ accuracy.  </p><p>from previous studies. We have shown that the category of the project influences the features that have a high correlation with funding success. We offer (example) for technological projects, as follows: + Entrepreneurs should update their project information during the funding period. + The project’s post should contain more feelings words. While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p><h2></h2> \n",

Hence, the question of what influences projects’ fundraising success is very important. Previous studies examined various factors such as project goals and project duration that may influence the outcomes of fundraising campaigns. We present a novel model for predicting the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. Our model focuses on semantic features only, whose performance is comparable to that of previous models. In an additional model we developed, we examine both project metadata and project semantics, delivering a comprehensive study of factors influencing crowdfunding success. Further, we analyze a large dataset of crowdfunding project data, larger than reportec in the art. Finally, we show that when combining semantics and metadata, we arrive at F1 score accuracy of 96.2%. We compare our model's accuracy to the accuracy of previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset, and demonstrate higher accuracy of our model. In addition to our scientific contribution, we provide practical recommendations that may increase project funding success chances.  </p><h2>Introduction  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding has emerged as a popular financing mechanism that allows various types of projects to get funded. Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/1.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/2.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/3.png\"/><p>Fig 2.

Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/6.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/7.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare.

The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/9.png\"/><p>Fig 3. Comparison of models’ accuracy.  </p><p>from previous studies. We have shown that the category of the project influences the features that have a high correlation with funding success. We offer (example) for technological projects, as follows: + Entrepreneurs should update their project information during the funding period. + The project’s post should contain more feelings words. While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p><h2></h2> \n",

Hence, the question of what influences projects’ fundraising success is very important. Previous studies examined various factors such as project goals and project duration that may influence the outcomes of fundraising campaigns. We present a novel model for predicting the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. Our model focuses on semantic features only, whose performance is comparable to that of previous models. In an additional model we developed, we examine both project metadata and project semantics, delivering a comprehensive study of factors influencing crowdfunding success. Further, we analyze a large dataset of crowdfunding project data, larger than reportec in the art. Finally, we show that when combining semantics and metadata, we arrive at F1 score accuracy of 96.2%. We compare our model's accuracy to the accuracy of previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset, and demonstrate higher accuracy of our model. In addition to our scientific contribution, we provide practical recommendations that may increase project funding success chances.  </p><h2>Introduction  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding has emerged as a popular financing mechanism that allows various types of projects to get funded. Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/1.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/2.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/3.png\"/><p>Fig 2.

Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model.

To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/6.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/7.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare. The Figure shows that the model we developed has the highest accuracy.

The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/9.png\"/><p>Fig 3.

We offer (example) for technological projects, as follows: + Entrepreneurs should update their project information during the funding period. + The project’s post should contain more feelings words. While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p><h2></h2> \n",

Hence, the question of what influences projects’ fundraising success is very important. Previous studies examined various factors such as project goals and project duration that may influence the outcomes of fundraising campaigns. We present a novel model for predicting the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. Our model focuses on semantic features only, whose performance is comparable to that of previous models. In an additional model we developed, we examine both project metadata and project semantics, delivering a comprehensive study of factors influencing crowdfunding success. Further, we analyze a large dataset of crowdfunding project data, larger than reportec in the art. Finally, we show that when combining semantics and metadata, we arrive at F1 score accuracy of 96.2%. We compare our model's accuracy to the accuracy of previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset, and demonstrate higher accuracy of our model. In addition to our scientific contribution, we provide practical recommendations that may increase project funding success chances.  </p><h2>Introduction  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding has emerged as a popular financing mechanism that allows various types of projects to get funded. Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/1.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/2.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/3.png\"/><p>Fig 2.

Features that most significantly influence funding success. In what follows we describe the war in which we faund the featurec that are mact influential far BS We need turn methnade a a the way in which we found the features that are most influential for FS. We used two methods The first is the Pearson correlation between the independent features and the dependent feature (i.e., the FS). The second is the CFS algorithm. , oe aa a, aa Features that highly correlate with funding success. Below in Table 1, for each of the three datasets, we list the 10 features for which the highest correlation values to FS were derived. The semantics of features annotated with * are provided in LIWC documentation (R_AILD stands for Ranked features from All_D). Feature selection. We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset. The CFS algorithm evaluates subsets of features based on the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. The following are the algorithm’s results. MSSF from All_D (S_ All_D):  </p><h2>* punc*  </h2><p>From the above results, we conclude that there are various semantic features that have a high correlation to FS among the features we checked based on the project’s category. Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/6.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/7.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features.

Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/1.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/2.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/3.png\"/><p>Fig 2.

Features that most significantly influence funding success. In what follows we describe the war in which we faund the featurec that are mact influential far BS We need turn methnade a a the way in which we found the features that are most influential for FS. We used two methods The first is the Pearson correlation between the independent features and the dependent feature (i.e., the FS). The second is the CFS algorithm. , oe aa a, aa Features that highly correlate with funding success. Below in Table 1, for each of the three datasets, we list the 10 features for which the highest correlation values to FS were derived. The semantics of features annotated with * are provided in LIWC documentation (R_AILD stands for Ranked features from All_D). Feature selection. We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset. The CFS algorithm evaluates subsets of features based on the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. The following are the algorithm’s results. MSSF from All_D (S_ All_D):  </p><h2>* punc*  </h2><p>From the above results, we conclude that there are various semantic features that have a high correlation to FS among the features we checked based on the project’s category. Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/6.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/7.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare.

Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/1.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/2.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/3.png\"/><p>Fig 2.

Features that most significantly influence funding success. In what follows we describe the war in which we faund the featurec that are mact influential far BS We need turn methnade a a the way in which we found the features that are most influential for FS.

We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset.

Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/6.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/7.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare. The Figure shows that the model we developed has the highest accuracy.

The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/9.png\"/><p>Fig 3. Comparison of models’ accuracy.  </p><p>from previous studies. We have shown that the category of the project influences the features that have a high correlation with funding success. We offer (example) for technological projects, as follows: + Entrepreneurs should update their project information during the funding period. + The project’s post should contain more feelings words. While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p><h2></h2> \n",

Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/1.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/2.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/3.png\"/><p>Fig 2.

Features that most significantly influence funding success. In what follows we describe the war in which we faund the featurec that are mact influential far BS We need turn methnade a a the way in which we found the features that are most influential for FS. We used two methods The first is the Pearson correlation between the independent features and the dependent feature (i.e., the FS). The second is the CFS algorithm. , oe aa a, aa Features that highly correlate with funding success. Below in Table 1, for each of the three datasets, we list the 10 features for which the highest correlation values to FS were derived. The semantics of features annotated with * are provided in LIWC documentation (R_AILD stands for Ranked features from All_D). Feature selection. We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset. The CFS algorithm evaluates subsets of features based on the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. The following are the algorithm’s results. MSSF from All_D (S_ All_D):  </p><h2>* punc*  </h2><p>From the above results, we conclude that there are various semantic features that have a high correlation to FS among the features we checked based on the project’s category. Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/6.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/7.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare. The Figure shows that the model we developed has the highest accuracy. The accuracy of the Semantic-Model is similar to the accuracy of the LDA-Model and higher than the accuracy of the  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/8.png\"/><h2>Conclusion and future work  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been offering entrepreneurs the possibility to present their projects and attract funders, and thus raise the funds necessary for their projects. The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/9.png\"/><p>Fig 3.

We offer (example) for technological projects, as follows: + Entrepreneurs should update their project information during the funding period. + The project’s post should contain more feelings words. While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p><h2></h2> \n",

Hence, the question of what influences projects’ fundraising success is very important. Previous studies examined various factors such as project goals and project duration that may influence the outcomes of fundraising campaigns. We present a novel model for predicting the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. Our model focuses on semantic features only, whose performance is comparable to that of previous models. In an additional model we developed, we examine both project metadata and project semantics, delivering a comprehensive study of factors influencing crowdfunding success. Further, we analyze a large dataset of crowdfunding project data, larger than reportec in the art.

In addition to our scientific contribution, we provide practical recommendations that may increase project funding success chances.  </p><h2>Introduction  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding has emerged as a popular financing mechanism that allows various types of projects to get funded. Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/1.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/2.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/3.png\"/><p>Fig 2. Methodology flowchart.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/4.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/5.png\"/><h2>Results  </h2><h2>Feature extraction and selection  </h2><p>In this section, we provide details of the data setup, the usage of the LDA algorithm, the feature correlation analysis, the feature selection process, and the development of a prediction model. Features that most significantly influence funding success. In what follows we describe the war in which we faund the featurec that are mact influential far BS We need turn methnade a a the way in which we found the features that are most influential for FS. We used two methods The first is the Pearson correlation between the independent features and the dependent feature (i.e., the FS). The second is the CFS algorithm. , oe aa a, aa Features that highly correlate with funding success. Below in Table 1, for each of the three datasets, we list the 10 features for which the highest correlation values to FS were derived. The semantics of features annotated with * are provided in LIWC documentation (R_AILD stands for Ranked features from All_D). Feature selection. We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset. The CFS algorithm evaluates subsets of features based on the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. The following are the algorithm’s results. MSSF from All_D (S_ All_D):  </p><h2>* punc*  </h2><p>From the above results, we conclude that there are various semantic features that have a high correlation to FS among the features we checked based on the project’s category. Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/6.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/7.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare. The Figure shows that the model we developed has the highest accuracy. The accuracy of the Semantic-Model is similar to the accuracy of the LDA-Model and higher than the accuracy of the  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/8.png\"/><h2>Conclusion and future work  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been offering entrepreneurs the possibility to present their projects and attract funders, and thus raise the funds necessary for their projects. The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/9.png\"/><p>Fig 3.

We offer (example) for technological projects, as follows: + Entrepreneurs should update their project information during the funding period. + The project’s post should contain more feelings words. While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p><h2></h2> \n",

Hence, the question of what influences projects’ fundraising success is very important. Previous studies examined various factors such as project goals and project duration that may influence the outcomes of fundraising campaigns. We present a novel model for predicting the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. Our model focuses on semantic features only, whose performance is comparable to that of previous models. In an additional model we developed, we examine both project metadata and project semantics, delivering a comprehensive study of factors influencing crowdfunding success. Further, we analyze a large dataset of crowdfunding project data, larger than reportec in the art. Finally, we show that when combining semantics and metadata, we arrive at F1 score accuracy of 96.2%. We compare our model's accuracy to the accuracy of previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset, and demonstrate higher accuracy of our model. In addition to our scientific contribution, we provide practical recommendations that may increase project funding success chances.  </p><h2>Introduction  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding has emerged as a popular financing mechanism that allows various types of projects to get funded. Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/1.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/2.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/3.png\"/><p>Fig 2. Methodology flowchart.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/4.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/5.png\"/><h2>Results  </h2><h2>Feature extraction and selection  </h2><p>In this section, we provide details of the data setup, the usage of the LDA algorithm, the feature correlation analysis, the feature selection process, and the development of a prediction model. Features that most significantly influence funding success. In what follows we describe the war in which we faund the featurec that are mact influential far BS We need turn methnade a a the way in which we found the features that are most influential for FS. We used two methods The first is the Pearson correlation between the independent features and the dependent feature (i.e., the FS). The second is the CFS algorithm. , oe aa a, aa Features that highly correlate with funding success. Below in Table 1, for each of the three datasets, we list the 10 features for which the highest correlation values to FS were derived. The semantics of features annotated with * are provided in LIWC documentation (R_AILD stands for Ranked features from All_D). Feature selection. We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset. The CFS algorithm evaluates subsets of features based on the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. The following are the algorithm’s results. MSSF from All_D (S_ All_D):  </p><h2>* punc*  </h2><p>From the above results, we conclude that there are various semantic features that have a high correlation to FS among the features we checked based on the project’s category. Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/6.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/7.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare. The Figure shows that the model we developed has the highest accuracy. The accuracy of the Semantic-Model is similar to the accuracy of the LDA-Model and higher than the accuracy of the  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/8.png\"/><h2>Conclusion and future work  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been offering entrepreneurs the possibility to present their projects and attract funders, and thus raise the funds necessary for their projects. The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/9.png\"/><p>Fig 3. Comparison of models’ accuracy.  </p><p>from previous studies. We have shown that the category of the project influences the features that have a high correlation with funding success. We offer (example) for technological projects, as follows: + Entrepreneurs should update their project information during the funding period. + The project’s post should contain more feelings words. While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p><h2></h2> \n",

Thus, great research efforts are devoted to understanding these interfacial processes in order to formulate guidelines for achieving control over their response, thereby enabling viable and long-lasting storage systems. In order to understand the interface (EEI), we need to be able to probe it. This is not a simple task: these interphases are thin, disordered, heterogeneous (composed of organic and inorganic phases), and can be very reactive. The EEIs are most commonly studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron microscopy (EM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and to some extent X-ray diffraction.) Establishing the composition and structure of interphases is a necessary step but it is not enough. To rationalize their effect on cell performance, we must be able to correlate their composition and architecture with their function, namely determine their ion transport properties. Impedance spectroscopy is commonly used to measure ionic transport and can be correlated to some extent with interfacial resistance, but it does not provide a direct means to follow transport.

Hence, the question of what influences projects’ fundraising success is very important. Previous studies examined various factors such as project goals and project duration that may influence the outcomes of fundraising campaigns. We present a novel model for predicting the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. Our model focuses on semantic features only, whose performance is comparable to that of previous models. In an additional model we developed, we examine both project metadata and project semantics, delivering a comprehensive study of factors influencing crowdfunding success. Further, we analyze a large dataset of crowdfunding project data, larger than reportec in the art. Finally, we show that when combining semantics and metadata, we arrive at F1 score accuracy of 96.2%. We compare our model's accuracy to the accuracy of previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset, and demonstrate higher accuracy of our model. In addition to our scientific contribution, we provide practical recommendations that may increase project funding success chances.  </p><h2>Introduction  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding has emerged as a popular financing mechanism that allows various types of projects to get funded. Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/46.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/47.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%.

Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/51.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/52.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare.

The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/54.png\"/><p>Fig 3.

We offer (example) for technological projects, as follows: + Entrepreneurs should update their project information during the funding period. + The project’s post should contain more feelings words. While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p> \n",

Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/46.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/47.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/48.png\"/><p>Fig 2.

The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D.

To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model.

As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN.

The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms.

While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts.

Hence, the question of what influences projects’ fundraising success is very important. Previous studies examined various factors such as project goals and project duration that may influence the outcomes of fundraising campaigns. We present a novel model for predicting the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. Our model focuses on semantic features only, whose performance is comparable to that of previous models. In an additional model we developed, we examine both project metadata and project semantics, delivering a comprehensive study of factors influencing crowdfunding success. Further, we analyze a large dataset of crowdfunding project data, larger than reportec in the art. Finally, we show that when combining semantics and metadata, we arrive at F1 score accuracy of 96.2%. We compare our model's accuracy to the accuracy of previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset, and demonstrate higher accuracy of our model. In addition to our scientific contribution, we provide practical recommendations that may increase project funding success chances.  </p><h2>Introduction  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding has emerged as a popular financing mechanism that allows various types of projects to get funded. Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/46.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/47.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/48.png\"/><p>Fig 2.

Features that most significantly influence funding success. In what follows we describe the war in which we faund the featurec that are mact influential far BS We need turn methnade a a the way in which we found the features that are most influential for FS. We used two methods The first is the Pearson correlation between the independent features and the dependent feature (i.e., the FS). The second is the CFS algorithm. , oe aa a, aa Features that highly correlate with funding success. Below in Table 1, for each of the three datasets, we list the 10 features for which the highest correlation values to FS were derived. The semantics of features annotated with * are provided in LIWC documentation (R_AILD stands for Ranked features from All_D). Feature selection. We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset. The CFS algorithm evaluates subsets of features based on the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. The following are the algorithm’s results. MSSF from All_D (S_ All_D):  </p><p>From the above results, we conclude that there are various semantic features that have a high correlation to FS among the features we checked based on the project’s category. Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/51.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/52.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features.

Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/46.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/47.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/48.png\"/><p>Fig 2.

Features that most significantly influence funding success. In what follows we describe the war in which we faund the featurec that are mact influential far BS We need turn methnade a a the way in which we found the features that are most influential for FS. We used two methods The first is the Pearson correlation between the independent features and the dependent feature (i.e., the FS). The second is the CFS algorithm. , oe aa a, aa Features that highly correlate with funding success. Below in Table 1, for each of the three datasets, we list the 10 features for which the highest correlation values to FS were derived. The semantics of features annotated with * are provided in LIWC documentation (R_AILD stands for Ranked features from All_D). Feature selection. We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset. The CFS algorithm evaluates subsets of features based on the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. The following are the algorithm’s results. MSSF from All_D (S_ All_D):  </p><p>From the above results, we conclude that there are various semantic features that have a high correlation to FS among the features we checked based on the project’s category. Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/51.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/52.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare. The Figure shows that the model we developed has the highest accuracy.

The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/54.png\"/><p>Fig 3.

While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p> \n",

Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/46.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/47.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/48.png\"/><p>Fig 2. Methodology flowchart.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/49.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/50.png\"/><h2>Results  </h2><h2>Feature extraction and selection  </h2><p>In this section, we provide details of the data setup, the usage of the LDA algorithm, the feature correlation analysis, the feature selection process, and the development of a prediction model. Features that most significantly influence funding success. In what follows we describe the war in which we faund the featurec that are mact influential far BS We need turn methnade a a the way in which we found the features that are most influential for FS. We used two methods The first is the Pearson correlation between the independent features and the dependent feature (i.e., the FS). The second is the CFS algorithm. , oe aa a, aa Features that highly correlate with funding success. Below in Table 1, for each of the three datasets, we list the 10 features for which the highest correlation values to FS were derived. The semantics of features annotated with * are provided in LIWC documentation (R_AILD stands for Ranked features from All_D). Feature selection. We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset. The CFS algorithm evaluates subsets of features based on the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. The following are the algorithm’s results. MSSF from All_D (S_ All_D):  </p><p>From the above results, we conclude that there are various semantic features that have a high correlation to FS among the features we checked based on the project’s category. Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/51.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/52.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare. The Figure shows that the model we developed has the highest accuracy.

The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/54.png\"/><p>Fig 3.

We offer (example) for technological projects, as follows: + Entrepreneurs should update their project information during the funding period. + The project’s post should contain more feelings words. While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p> \n",

Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/46.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/47.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/48.png\"/><p>Fig 2. Methodology flowchart.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/49.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/50.png\"/><h2>Results  </h2><h2>Feature extraction and selection  </h2><p>In this section, we provide details of the data setup, the usage of the LDA algorithm, the feature correlation analysis, the feature selection process, and the development of a prediction model. Features that most significantly influence funding success. In what follows we describe the war in which we faund the featurec that are mact influential far BS We need turn methnade a a the way in which we found the features that are most influential for FS. We used two methods The first is the Pearson correlation between the independent features and the dependent feature (i.e., the FS). The second is the CFS algorithm. , oe aa a, aa Features that highly correlate with funding success. Below in Table 1, for each of the three datasets, we list the 10 features for which the highest correlation values to FS were derived. The semantics of features annotated with * are provided in LIWC documentation (R_AILD stands for Ranked features from All_D). Feature selection. We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset. The CFS algorithm evaluates subsets of features based on the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. The following are the algorithm’s results. MSSF from All_D (S_ All_D):  </p><p>From the above results, we conclude that there are various semantic features that have a high correlation to FS among the features we checked based on the project’s category. Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/51.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/52.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare. The Figure shows that the model we developed has the highest accuracy. The accuracy of the Semantic-Model is similar to the accuracy of the LDA-Model and higher than the accuracy of the  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/53.png\"/><h2>Conclusion and future work  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been offering entrepreneurs the possibility to present their projects and attract funders, and thus raise the funds necessary for their projects. The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/54.png\"/><p>Fig 3. Comparison of models’ accuracy.  </p><p>from previous studies. We have shown that the category of the project influences the features that have a high correlation with funding success. We offer (example) for technological projects, as follows: + Entrepreneurs should update their project information during the funding period. + The project’s post should contain more feelings words. While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p> \n",

Hence, the question of what influences projects’ fundraising success is very important. Previous studies examined various factors such as project goals and project duration that may influence the outcomes of fundraising campaigns. We present a novel model for predicting the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. Our model focuses on semantic features only, whose performance is comparable to that of previous models. In an additional model we developed, we examine both project metadata and project semantics, delivering a comprehensive study of factors influencing crowdfunding success. Further, we analyze a large dataset of crowdfunding project data, larger than reportec in the art.

In addition to our scientific contribution, we provide practical recommendations that may increase project funding success chances.  </p><h2>Introduction  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding has emerged as a popular financing mechanism that allows various types of projects to get funded. Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/46.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/47.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/48.png\"/><p>Fig 2. Methodology flowchart.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/49.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/50.png\"/><h2>Results  </h2><h2>Feature extraction and selection  </h2><p>In this section, we provide details of the data setup, the usage of the LDA algorithm, the feature correlation analysis, the feature selection process, and the development of a prediction model. Features that most significantly influence funding success. In what follows we describe the war in which we faund the featurec that are mact influential far BS We need turn methnade a a the way in which we found the features that are most influential for FS. We used two methods The first is the Pearson correlation between the independent features and the dependent feature (i.e., the FS).

Below in Table 1, for each of the three datasets, we list the 10 features for which the highest correlation values to FS were derived. The semantics of features annotated with * are provided in LIWC documentation (R_AILD stands for Ranked features from All_D). Feature selection. We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset. The CFS algorithm evaluates subsets of features based on the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. The following are the algorithm’s results. MSSF from All_D (S_ All_D):  </p><p>From the above results, we conclude that there are various semantic features that have a high correlation to FS among the features we checked based on the project’s category. Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/51.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/52.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare. The Figure shows that the model we developed has the highest accuracy.

The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/54.png\"/><p>Fig 3.

We offer (example) for technological projects, as follows: + Entrepreneurs should update their project information during the funding period. + The project’s post should contain more feelings words. While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p> \n",

Hence, the question of what influences projects’ fundraising success is very important. Previous studies examined various factors such as project goals and project duration that may influence the outcomes of fundraising campaigns. We present a novel model for predicting the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. Our model focuses on semantic features only, whose performance is comparable to that of previous models. In an additional model we developed, we examine both project metadata and project semantics, delivering a comprehensive study of factors influencing crowdfunding success. Further, we analyze a large dataset of crowdfunding project data, larger than reportec in the art. Finally, we show that when combining semantics and metadata, we arrive at F1 score accuracy of 96.2%. We compare our model's accuracy to the accuracy of previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset, and demonstrate higher accuracy of our model. In addition to our scientific contribution, we provide practical recommendations that may increase project funding success chances.  </p><h2>Introduction  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding has emerged as a popular financing mechanism that allows various types of projects to get funded. Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/46.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/47.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/48.png\"/><p>Fig 2.

Features that most significantly influence funding success. In what follows we describe the war in which we faund the featurec that are mact influential far BS We need turn methnade a a the way in which we found the features that are most influential for FS.

We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset.

Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/51.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/52.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare.

The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/54.png\"/><p>Fig 3. Comparison of models’ accuracy.  </p><p>from previous studies. We have shown that the category of the project influences the features that have a high correlation with funding success. We offer (example) for technological projects, as follows: + Entrepreneurs should update their project information during the funding period. + The project’s post should contain more feelings words. While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p> \n",

Hence, the question of what influences projects’ fundraising success is very important. Previous studies examined various factors such as project goals and project duration that may influence the outcomes of fundraising campaigns. We present a novel model for predicting the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. Our model focuses on semantic features only, whose performance is comparable to that of previous models. In an additional model we developed, we examine both project metadata and project semantics, delivering a comprehensive study of factors influencing crowdfunding success. Further, we analyze a large dataset of crowdfunding project data, larger than reportec in the art. Finally, we show that when combining semantics and metadata, we arrive at F1 score accuracy of 96.2%. We compare our model's accuracy to the accuracy of previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset, and demonstrate higher accuracy of our model. In addition to our scientific contribution, we provide practical recommendations that may increase project funding success chances.  </p><h2>Introduction  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding has emerged as a popular financing mechanism that allows various types of projects to get funded. Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/46.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/47.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/48.png\"/><p>Fig 2.

Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/51.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/52.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare.

The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/54.png\"/><p>Fig 3.

We offer (example) for technological projects, as follows: + Entrepreneurs should update their project information during the funding period. + The project’s post should contain more feelings words. While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p> \n",

Hence, the question of what influences projects’ fundraising success is very important. Previous studies examined various factors such as project goals and project duration that may influence the outcomes of fundraising campaigns. We present a novel model for predicting the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. Our model focuses on semantic features only, whose performance is comparable to that of previous models. In an additional model we developed, we examine both project metadata and project semantics, delivering a comprehensive study of factors influencing crowdfunding success. Further, we analyze a large dataset of crowdfunding project data, larger than reportec in the art. Finally, we show that when combining semantics and metadata, we arrive at F1 score accuracy of 96.2%. We compare our model's accuracy to the accuracy of previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset, and demonstrate higher accuracy of our model. In addition to our scientific contribution, we provide practical recommendations that may increase project funding success chances.  </p><h2>Introduction  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding has emerged as a popular financing mechanism that allows various types of projects to get funded. Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/46.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/47.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/48.png\"/><p>Fig 2.

The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/51.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/52.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features.

The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. ‘These are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/54.png\"/><p>Fig 3.

While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms, e.g., [29].  </p> \n",

Hence, the question of what influences projects’ fundraising success is very important. Previous studies examined various factors such as project goals and project duration that may influence the outcomes of fundraising campaigns. We present a novel model for predicting the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. Our model focuses on semantic features only, whose performance is comparable to that of previous models. In an additional model we developed, we examine both project metadata and project semantics, delivering a comprehensive study of factors influencing crowdfunding success. Further, we analyze a large dataset of crowdfunding project data, larger than reportec in the art. Finally, we show that when combining semantics and metadata, we arrive at F1 score accuracy of 96.2%. We compare our model's accuracy to the accuracy of previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset, and demonstrate higher accuracy of our model. In addition to our scientific contribution, we provide practical recommendations that may increase project funding success chances.  </p><h2>Introduction  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding has emerged as a popular financing mechanism that allows various types of projects to get funded. Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/46.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/47.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/48.png\"/><p>Fig 2.

Features that most significantly influence funding success. In what follows we describe the war in which we faund the featurec that are mact influential far BS We need turn methnade a a the way in which we found the features that are most influential for FS. We used two methods The first is the Pearson correlation between the independent features and the dependent feature (i.e., the FS). The second is the CFS algorithm. , oe aa a, aa Features that highly correlate with funding success. Below in Table 1, for each of the three datasets, we list the 10 features for which the highest correlation values to FS were derived. The semantics of features annotated with * are provided in LIWC documentation (R_AILD stands for Ranked features from All_D). Feature selection. We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset. The CFS algorithm evaluates subsets of features based on the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. The following are the algorithm’s results. MSSF from All_D (S_ All_D):  </p><p>From the above results, we conclude that there are various semantic features that have a high correlation to FS among the features we checked based on the project’s category. Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/51.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/52.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features.

Hence, the question of what influences projects’ fundraising success is very important. Previous studies examined various factors such as project goals and project duration that may influence the outcomes of fundraising campaigns. We present a novel model for predicting the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. Our model focuses on semantic features only, whose performance is comparable to that of previous models. In an additional model we developed, we examine both project metadata and project semantics, delivering a comprehensive study of factors influencing crowdfunding success. Further, we analyze a large dataset of crowdfunding project data, larger than reportec in the art. Finally, we show that when combining semantics and metadata, we arrive at F1 score accuracy of 96.2%. We compare our model's accuracy to the accuracy of previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset, and demonstrate higher accuracy of our model. In addition to our scientific contribution, we provide practical recommendations that may increase project funding success chances.  </p><h2>Introduction  </h2><p>In recent years, crowdfunding has emerged as a popular financing mechanism that allows various types of projects to get funded. Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied  </p><p>the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]:  </p><ul><li>. Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project.  </li></ul><p>Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects’ details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc., can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project’s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project’s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project’s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc. Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as  </p><p>Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project’s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. ‘This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects’ description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.  </p><h2>Background  </h2><p>In this section, we discuss the features used in our models, highlighting where we differ from previous studies. We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects’ textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects’ posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.  </p><h2>Buzzwords  </h2><p>The analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs.  </p><p>Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc. In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text i.e., project’s description.  </p><h2>Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)  </h2><p>To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool. LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse’, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic’, etc. + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant’, glad, etc. The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1» Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (e.g., F-score &gt; 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.  </p><h2>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  </h2><p>Topic modeling methods are used in text mining tasks to extract topics from text. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Oncé the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform  </p><p>lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.  </p><h2>Metadata  </h2><p>Additionally, we incorporated metadata features known to affect funding success. The metadata features we used were extracted from projects’ posts via Python web scraping. The set we used for our analysis included the number of photos, the number of videos, the number of updates, the funding goal, the number of previously created projects by entrepreneur, the number of successfully completed (a.k.a. backed) entrepreneur's projects, and the time to achieve that goal (i.e., the project’s deadline) [7,12,17-22].  </p><h2>Additional semantic features  </h2><p>In addition to topics identified by LIWC and LDA, we explored additional topics that could have a high correlation to FS by reviewing those used by studies in the field of textual analysis. ‘The following additional topics were deduced:  </p><ul><li>« Explanation words: example, explain, for instance, i.e., mean, in other words, in that, that is, etc. [23]. «+ Feelings words: angry, annoyed, afraid, awkward, affectionate, anxious, alarmed, awed, aggravated, amazed, etc. This bag of words comes from the unification of LIWC dictionaries that include feeling words [24].  </li></ul><h2>Performance metrics  </h2><p>We used the following metrics to measure the performance of our models. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the total predicted positive records. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive records to the all records in actual class. F-score (also denoted F,) is the weighted harmonic mean of a model’s precision and recall. These metrics are calculated as follows:  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/46.png\"/><p>Where tp is the number of true positive predictions. fn and fp are the number of false negatives and false positives predictions, respectively.  </p><h2>Methodology  </h2><p>In order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. ‘The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc. For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA’s topic X was subsumed into LIWC’s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/47.png\"/><p>The PCA plots in Fig 1 present the distribution of the All_D, Market_D and Tech_D datasets. Each dot in the plots represents a project record in the dataset. Dots in blue represent unsuccessfully funded projects and dots in red represent successfully funded projects. Most of the records of the successfully funded projects are located in the range where PC3 &lt; 0.5, -1 &lt; PC2 &lt; 0,1 &lt; PCI &lt; 2. To identify the most significant set of features (MSSF) that has the highest impact on ES, we use the CES feature selection) algorithm. CFS evaluates a subset of features by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. We executed this algorithm on each dataset, separately. In this study, as mentioned above, we developed two binary classification models to predict funding success. The labels of the two classes are J and 0, where 1 is the label of the class of successfully funded projects and 0 is the label of the class of unsuccessfully funded projects. To develop those models, we utilized widely used classification algorithms (Random forest, decision trees, DNN) as well as leading algorithms such as LightGBM [27]. The models’ design, derivation, and operational tests were conducted using the following Python packages: scikit-learn, scikit-feature and LightGBM. Recall that one of our goals was to develop the semantic-model whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of existing models. To this end, we developed a model whose features are only semantic features. The inputs of that model consist of buzzwords, explanation words, feeling words and the topics derived from LIWC and LDA. Once the semantic-model was developed and tested, we aimed to further improve model accuracy. To this end, we have developed the whose novelty lies in the  </p><p>combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model’s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%. Fig 2 includes a flowchart of the methodology. To validate the results of our study, we compared our model’s accuracy to previous research models by applying their methods on our dataset.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/48.png\"/><p>Fig 2.

Features that most significantly influence funding success. In what follows we describe the war in which we faund the featurec that are mact influential far BS We need turn methnade a a the way in which we found the features that are most influential for FS. We used two methods The first is the Pearson correlation between the independent features and the dependent feature (i.e., the FS). The second is the CFS algorithm. , oe aa a, aa Features that highly correlate with funding success. Below in Table 1, for each of the three datasets, we list the 10 features for which the highest correlation values to FS were derived. The semantics of features annotated with * are provided in LIWC documentation (R_AILD stands for Ranked features from All_D). Feature selection. We used the CFS algorithm to find MSSF in every dataset. The CFS algorithm evaluates subsets of features based on the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. The following are the algorithm’s results. MSSF from All_D (S_ All_D):  </p><p>From the above results, we conclude that there are various semantic features that have a high correlation to FS among the features we checked based on the project’s category. Correlation values similar to those computed in our study are typical in the art [12,19]. The semantic features buzzwords and LIWC are among the features that have a higher correlation in all datasets. When inspecting the correlation analysis results, we can observe that among the top 10 features, about 70% of the features are the same across datasets. For example, the features feelings_num and buzz_num appear in the three top 10 lists. In contrast, the parameter WC is unique in the R_Tech _D top 10 list and the parameter number is distinctive in the R_Market_D top 10 list. An important, unique conclusion of our study is that the features correlated to FS are dependent on the project category.  </p><h2>A model for predicting funding success  </h2><p>Semantic model. For the development of the semantic features were used as input. We utilized several machine learning algorithms (including SVM, J48, Random Forest, LightGBM, SDG, DNN, and more) on All_D. Table 2 presents the accuracies metrics of the Combined model. To develop the we utilized the same classification algorithms as used for the development of the Semantic-Model on our three datasets, using all features. Below we list the best models (by F-score). We used the grid search algorithm to optimize the with which each algorithm was executed (for example, for SDG we optimized batch size, number of epochs, etc.). In addition to the grid search algorithm, we utilized the Random search algorithm and got similar accuracies for our classification models. The grid search algorithm selected a set of and these were used for training our model. Specifically, the following were used for All_D dataset: + Random forest: number of trees = 20, max depth = infinity, max number of features = unlimited.  </p><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/51.png\"/><img src=\"@API_IMAGES_URL@/text/i/52.png\"/><p>+ LightGBM: number of leaves = 255, number of boosting iterations = 5000, Minimal number of data in one leaf = 10, learning rate = 0.01, max number of bins = 300. As seen above, the semantic-model we have developed is comparable in accuracy with the state of the art (metadata) models, exhibiting an accuracy level of 91.2%. Further, as shown in ‘Table 3, by combining the semantic model with the metadata model, we have achieved an accuracy level of 96.2%. Additionally, as seen across Tables 3-5, the LightGBM algorithm exhibited a high accuracy level for all three datasets. In particular, with LightGBM, the accuracy of the prediction model is greater than 94% for all datasets.  </p><h2>Comparing our model to earlier models  </h2><p>To better understand the significance of our results, we compared them to results of earlier studies. To this end, we implemented two models from earlier studies and trained them on the AlL_D dataset to compare their accuracy to that of the Sematic-Model and the CombinedModel. In the first study [14], developed their best model (by means of F-score accuracy metrics) and trained it on 80 LDA features that were extracted from project descriptions. Relying on their method, we tried different numbers of topics in the range of 5 to 100. We did the same for each textual corpus and observed the corresponding perplexity scores. Using perplexity, we found 30 topics to be the best fit. We denote the model that trained on those features LDA-Model. In the second study [18], utilized only metadata features to develop their prediction model. We denote the model that trained on those features Our study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To this end, we examined the influence of the learning algorithms, the feature sets and the dataset on the derived F-score. Accordingly, we trained the LDA-Model and the Metadata-Model with the algorithms that were used in the studies above, and with additional algorithms, including SVM, J48, Random forest, LightGBM, SDG, and DNN. This training was performed on All_D with 10-fold This extensive experimental trial led to the conclusion that neither the learning algorithms nor the dataset are a source of significant differences in F-score. ‘The major effector of such differences is the set of features. Fig 3 presents the highest F-score metric values of the LDA-Model, the the Semantic-Model and the CombinedModel. F-score is used for consistency with the earlier studies to which we compare. The Figure shows that the model we developed has the highest accuracy.

While the energy density of the cell is mostly determined by the redox potential of the electrodes and amount of charge they can store, the processes at the interface govern the battery’s lifetime and performance. Viable battery cells rely on unimpeded ion transport across this interface, which depends on its composition and structure. These properties are challenging to determine as interfacial phases are thin, disordered, heterogeneous, and can be very reactive. The recent developments and applications of solid state NMR spectroscopy in the study of interfacial phenomena in rechargeable batteries based on lithium and sodium chemistries are reviewed. The different NMR interactions are surveyed and how these are used to shed light on the chemical composition and architecture of interfacial phases as well as directly probe ion transport across them is described.
